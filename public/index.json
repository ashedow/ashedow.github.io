This change is set to begin on October 26, with Group 4 passengers boarding first.\nPassengers with window seats will be the first to board, followed by those with middle seats and then those with aisle seats. Families and passengers on the same economy reservation will be allowed to board together.\nFirst-class and business-class passengers, as well as pre-boarding groups (including travelers with disabilities, unaccompanied minors, active-duty military, and families with young children), will not see any changes to their boarding procedures.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the point? # WilMA boarding is when passengers board the plane based on whether they\u0026rsquo;re sitting at the window seat, the middle seat or the aisle seat. This method claims to increase boarding efficiency since it means there are fewer people standing in the way while others try to get to their seats.\nInplementation of this process may saves an average of two minutes per flight. This is not an insignificant savings. Ground time costs airlines an estimated $100 a minute. A $200 savings per flight, multiplied over the 4,900 daily flights the airline operates, means nearly $1 million in daily savings.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown for boarding:\nPre-boarding for special groups. Premium cabins, status holders, and specific seat categories. Window seat and exit row passengers. NEW: Middle seat passengers. Aisle seat passengers. Basic economy and those without a specified boarding group. Loading an Airliner Is Rocket Science Department Fahrzeugtechnik und Flugzeugbau. Optimal Boarding Methods for Airlaine Passengers PDF List of methods of plane boarding # Episode of MythBusters from a few years ago, where six methods of plane boarding were tested.\nRandom With Assigned Seats # With this boarding method, passengers all had seats assigned. Business class boarded first, and then everyone else was let on at once.\nRandom Without Assigned Seats # This method is exactly what it sounds like: let business class passengers board first, and then everyone else sits where they like.\nBack-To-Front # Because it is easier to implement, the most common strategy is back-to-front. The plane\u0026rsquo;s last row is the first to board in this case. All rows are seated before the front rows get to board. Some airlines simplify back-to-front boarding by calling for blocks of people to board back to front.\nWindow, Middle, Aisle Boarding (WILMA) # Business class is boarded first — you may see a pattern emerging here. Then all of the window seats are boarded next, followed by all the middle seats and then all the aisle seats.\nReverse Pyramid # The Reverse Pyramid combines back-to-front and outside-in approaches. It was developed by America West Airlines and Arizona State University. The first passengers to board are in back window seats, followed by window seats in the center and front. Then middle seats in the same order. Aisle seats at the front are the last passengers to board.\nWILMA in Blocks # A slight variation of the traditional window, middle, aisle system is WILMA in blocks.\nThis boarding method combines WILMA with back to front boarding, starting with business class in two sections, followed by the window seats to the rear, and then the middle and aisle seats to the rear. We then move onto the window seats of the next section up, followed by the middle and aisle seats of the same section, and so on.\nSteffen Boarding # Astrophysicist Jason Steffen developed the eponymous Steffen boarding strategy in 2008. In Steffen\u0026rsquo;s strategy( PDF), passengers are called one by one to board. Boarding is still based on outside in, windows to aisles. To avoid crowding, passengers board two rows apart. Though theoretically the most effective method for boarding, it is not practical. Gate agents have more work, and families and couples sitting together may not want to leave someone behind.\nModified Optimal # Modified optimal boarding divides passengers into four groups and boards them in alternating rows. Passengers in even rows on one side of the plane make up the first group. Next are the passengers on the other side of the plane, sitting in even rows. The process repeats for odd rows.\nBingo Boarding # In 2019, easyJet and Gatwick Airport trialed a hybrid method called bingo boarding. It was a variation of the reverse pyramid strategy, combining back-to-front and outside-in. It also adopted an element of the Steffens strategy. A gate screen display showed the seat numbers as they were called to board the plane. This boarding strategy resulted in a 10% reduction in boarding time. But their 14-minute average is still higher than the United Airlines WILMA approach.\nLinks # Optimal boarding method for airline passengers The Optimum Way to Board a Plane PDF insider ","date":"6 November 2023","permalink":"/posts/wilma/","section":"Posts","summary":"WILMA or how to accommodate passengers on an aeroplane # United Airlines plans to improve boarding efficiency by implementing a new process called \u0026ldquo;WILMA\u0026rdquo; (window-middle-aisle).

SS7 primarily sets up and tears down telephone calls, but other uses include number translation, prepaid billing mechanisms, local number portability, short message service (SMS), and a variety of mass-market services.\nThe signaling transport (SIGTRAN) protocols provide interoperability of SS7 signaling to operate over (IP)-based networks. This enables PSTN service to operate over legacy, analog plain old telephone service systems and modern IP networking equipment. SIGTRAN uses its own Stream Control Transmission Protocol, as opposed to Transmission Control Protocol or User Datagram Protocol.\nTo remove the issues of in-band signaling, SS7 uses out-of-band signaling, called common channel signaling (CCS). In CCS, a dedicated channel separate from the voice channel is used to carry the SS7 control signals. This channel is only accessible to the underlying infrastructure and not the end callers, increasing security.\nServices offered by SS7 include the following:\nBasic call setup, management, and teardown call forwarding automated voicemail call waiting conference calling threeway calling caller ID subscriber authentication and extended billing Wireless services such as personal communications services (PCS), wireless roaming, and mobile subscriber authentication Local number portability (LNP) toll-free (800 and 888) and toll (900) calls SMS (Short Message Service) Efficient worldwide telecommunications mobile phone roaming and tracking SS7 is a longstanding telecommunications protocol and standard for both landline and mobile phone service.\nSS7 network has three main types of nodes. Each node has specific functionalities:\nSignaling Switching Points (SSP) This node terminates the wireless side (BSC/BTS) and connects to the rest of the network over SS7. An SSP may be connected to another SSP directly, or it may be connected via a signaling gateway. MSC, or mobile switching center, is an example of SSP. MSC provides roaming, messaging, billing, and call control functionalities.\nSignaling Transfer Point (STP) This node is working as a router in the SS7 network. The primary important role is to do Global Title Translation and select the next node for the message. The next node may be SSP or another STP.\nSignaling Control Point (SCP) This node has a database and maintains a centralized service. For a service, these nodes are contacted. Many SSPs can contact a single SCP. HLR or Home Location Register is an example of SCP in the GSM network. When a mobile phone is switched on, it tries to attach first to MSC (SSP), and then MSC sends a location update to the HLR. The MSC may change, but the HLR remains the same. A mobile operator can map location information with time.\nSSPs originate or terminate a call and are the initial point on the SS7 network. The control signals are routed through various STPs, which operate as interconnected switches on the SS7 network. The SCPs determine how to route a call or set up and manage some special feature.\nSCPs and STPs usually exist as a collection of discrete nodes so that service can continue if one network point fails. The SCPs may also communicate with a Service Data Point, which stores the user database and directory. The signaling links between nodes generally operate at full-duplex 56 or 64 kilobits per second (Kbps) bandwidth, with large facilities using a full T1 line at 1.536 megabits per second (Mbps) for signaling links.\nSS7 allows for several modes of operation for both voice and data service, including the following:\nMessage Transfer Part carries SS7 signals between nodes. Telephone User Part carries voice calls between users. Data User Part carries digital data between users. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) could also be used, enabling digital voice or data service at a relatively high speed, for the time, of up to 128 Kbps or 1.5 Mbps for a full T1 line. ISDN did not see wide adoption in the consumer market because, by the time it was widely available, 56.6 Kbps modems were becoming available as well. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line service widely superseded ISDN data service.\nWhat are the layers in an SS7 Protocol stack? # Message Transfer Part 1 (MTP1) – Physical Layer # Transfers bits over a physical channel in the form of electrical signals. Have physical ports to connect the cables. A card may have its CPU and RAM. When someone buys an SS7 card, it also comes with MTP2. An SS7 card may have multiple ports with multiple channels (32 – E1, 24 -T1).\nMessage Transfer Part 2( MTP2) – Data Link Layer # Transfers the error-free frames between two directly connected nodes. It maintains the receiver and sender windows. It uses sliding window protocol and retransmissions for flow and error control.\nfunctions of the MTP2 layer # Error Control- checks the error in a received frame based on 16 bits CRC. Re-transmits lost message or error message. Message Sequencing– maintains the sequencing of messages between directly connected nodes. Forward and backward sequencing numbers are maintained for sequence and retransmissions. Link Alignment– provides link alignment procedures when requested from its user(MTP3). Flow control– if the receiver is slow, sending mtp2 gives an indication to its user for congestion. Link Status– link status is given to the user. The status may be, in service(UP), out of service(DOWN), or congestion(CONGESTED). Message Transfer Part 3(MTP3) – Network Layer # This is the network layer that implements the mtp3 protocol. This does end-to-end routing of SS7 messages. This is the network layer in the ss7 protocol stack. For routing mtp3 routing, the level is defined. The routing level is defined in the MTP3 header, which contains OPC, DPC, and SLS. Mtp3 specification is given in Q.704. DPC is the point code of the destination ss7 node, OPC is the originating point code, and SLS is used for the load distribution of MTP3 user messages over links.\nWhen a message is passed from MTP2 to MTP3, the routing level, SIO, and MTP3 user data are passed in the message. MTP3 has two primary functions, discrimination, and distribution. The discrimination function decides if the message is for the self node or some distance node. The discrimination function uses DPC. If a message is for a self-node, it is passed to the distribution function.\nThe distribution function checks SI, which is part of SIO. The value of SI identifies the user of MTP3. For Eg, if SI is 5, the message is delivered to the ISUP layer over MTP3. If the value of SI is 3, then the message is delivered to the user (SCCP/ISUP).\nfunctions of MTP3 # Remote Point code status management, mtp3 maintains the configuration of remote point code and its status. The status may be available or unavailable. The user of mtp3 gets PAUSE or RESUME indications for a configured remote point code. During the routing of a message, the status of the remote point code is checked.\nLink Alignment: Once a link is configured at MTP2 and MTP3 levels, the MTP3 layer starts the link alignment by issuing an alignment primitive to the MTP2 layer. This starts link alignment at the mtp3 level. Once a link comes up on the mtp2 level. MTP3 receives an in-service indication from the MTP2 layer. MTP3 sends an SLTM message to the remote end. If SLTA is received in response to SLTM, the link is marked up at the mtp3 level. If the link is the first link in a link set, then it’s an emergency link alignment procedure, else it’s a normal link alignment procedure.\nTransfer Prohibited (TFP): This is the MTP3 procedure by which a signaling point code can mark a route unavailable for a destination point code. This updates the routing table for a destination point code when a signaling transfer point (STP) detects an unreachable point code.\nLoad Sharing does the load sharing over Linkset and links based on SLS received from the user.\nChange Over, when a link fails, the failed link’s traffic is distributed to the available links.\nChange Back, when a failed link comes back, the traffic is rerouted to the association.\nSS7 vulnerabilities and security implications # The telecommunications (telecom) industry developed Signaling System 7 before digital encryption and authentication were widely adopted. This means that SS7 messages and service can be relatively easily listened in on and forged.\nUnfortunately, the primary security on the SS7 network is that it is a closed system; only telecom operators have access to it. End users and most hackers cannot access the system as a whole. Telecom providers operating as bad actors or governmental agencies with legal access have relatively unrestricted access to all the information available in the SS7 network. Telecom providers can also monitor the SS7 network for threats or intrude and identify them, but this does not prevent passive exploitation.\nGiven the rich feature set and nonexistent security of SS7, this gives these threat actors unprecedented access to user information. It also gives governments the ability to track mobile users\u0026rsquo; location anywhere in the world, even without the use of the Global Positioning System.\nWhile Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) calls are encrypted over the air, the decryption key can be requested from the SS7 network for later decryption. SMS messages are sent unencrypted over the SS7 network and can be easily read. This type of snooping is called a SS7 probe or international mobile subscriber identity catcher. Attackers have used call forwarding to redirect calls or SMS multifactor authentication codes to ones controlled by an attacker to steal from bank accounts.\nWith the underlying vulnerability of the SS7 network, the only way not to be at risk is to not use telephone service. This would entail disabling telephone and mobile data service on a cellphone to prevent tracking. Voice and text messages should be sent using encrypted IP-based services, such as iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal.\nSignaling Connection Control Part (SCCP) – Transport Layer # It works as a transport layer and uses the service of MTP3. Do the segmentation/reassembly of large messages if required. A user application is identified by an SSN (an integer value). An SSN is a standard numeric value identifying an application/node in the GSM network.\nHLR – SSN 6 VLR-SSN 7 MSC – SSN 8 SGSN – SSN 149 In the telecom network, an SCCP layer is identified by a Global title. A global title is a sequence of digits that is unique globally. Your phone number with country code is an example of a global title. The SCCP layer does SSN management, global title translation, and other functions.\nSSN management: SSN configured on the SCCP layer can be local or remote. Before sending a message to a peer SSN, SCCP layers check the status of the remote SSN. If it is down, the message is dropped. To check the status of an SSN, a peer transmits the SST and waits for SSA. This procedure is optional. A remote SSN can be marked as available when a peer point code comes up after successful link alignment.\nGlobal Title Translation: An SCCP address has called party and calling party address in the SCCP header. Both addresses are global titles. Upon receiving, SCCP checks if GT matches the current node. If yes, then the Called Party GT is translated to the point code of the current node. The message is delivered to the local user identified by the called party SSN in the incoming messages.\nIf a message is not of local use, the GT can be translated into another GT or PC. Or it can be forwarded to the next hope. If the current nodes know the point code serving the called party address, the gt is translated on point code. Else forward to the next hop.\nSCCP message classes: Class 0, connection less non sequenced message. Class 1, connection less sequenced delivery of messages. Class 2, connection oriented without flow control. Class 3, connection oriented with flow control. User Primitives of SCCP Layer: A user primitive is the interface a layer provides to access its services. SCCP Provides request primitives to request a service from the layer, and Indication primitives, to inform events received from the network.\nPSTN # PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network - is a collection of interconnected public telephone networks that rely on physical infrastructure to connect phone calls. PSTN refers to the traditional telephone system used for voice-oriented communications. It consists of multiple interconnected carriers to reliably connect people through standard phone numbers.\nThis telephone network is known as analog, landlines, Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), or fixed lines. This system has been in general use since the late 1800s.\nUsing underground copper wires and circuit-switching, this legacy service has provided businesses and households with a reliable means to communicate with anyone worldwide for generations.\nWhen you place a call on the PSTN, the call hits multiple touchpoints, or offices, before your call reaches the phone on the other end of the line. The call travels through physical wires to each relevant office—which varies depending on its final destination—and each office is equipped with physical infrastructure designed to send the call to the next office until it reaches its intended receiver. It’s not complicated, but the amount of infrastructure and touchpoints involved means it’s challenging to match the instant data transmission offered by modern telephony solutions like VoIP.\nPSTN routing and call flow # When you pick up the phone and dial, several things take place that enable your call to connect.\nHere’s how it works:\nThe caller picks up a phone, hears a dial tone and dials a phone number. Once the call is received, the phone works to convert sound waves (your voice) into electrical signals that can be transmitted to a terminal via cables. The electrical signals are then sent by the terminal to the central office or local exchange. Once the central office receives the electrical signals, they are routed to the correct destination through cables in the form of light or electrical pulses, depending on the type of cable used. When the call reaches its destination, it is converted back to electrical signals and routed to the correct terminal. Finally, the terminal routes the call to the correct phone number. Once the phone receives the electrical signals, it converts those signals back into sound waves, which allows for nearly instantaneous communication between callers. Because of the way calls are routed, it’s possible to physically trace the origin of any call. This makes the PSTN ideal for use cases like emergency services—even if a caller is not able to identify or communicate their location, the 911 dispatcher can trace the call and send help to the correct place.\nKey terms:\nThe local exchange\nA local exchange – consisting of one or more exchanges – connects subscribers to a PSTN line. Also known as a central office or a switching exchange, a telephone exchange can have up to 10,000 lines. All phones are connected to the local exchange in a specific area. The exchange identifies the number dialed to route the call to the correct destination.\nCentral office (CO)\nA central office, also known as the local exchange, is usually made up of one or more offices that connect subscribers to a PSTN line. The central office a subscriber is connected to usually depends on their geographical location. The exchange then identifies the number being dialed, and routes it to the desired destination.\nTandem office\nA tandem office, also known as a junction network, is a step up from the local exchange. It serves a larger geographical area, and is made up of multiple local exchanges. The tandem office has the capability of routing calls between local exchanges.\nToll office\nEvery national long-distance switching takes place here. A toll office is connected to all tandem offices. For instance, if you dial a branch of your office in another city, your call will go through a toll office.\nInternational gateway\nInternational gateways manage international call switching, routing domestic calls to the appropriate countries.\nThe PSTN alternative: # PSTN vs. VoIP # VoIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol. It means voice communication is transmitted over the internet or private wide area network (WAN). VoIP is also known as IP telephony, internet telephony, or broadband telephony.\nVoIP eliminates the need for circuit-switched networks for phone calls as it sends your voice communications over the internet rather than through cables. This means you’ll need a reliable internet connection. It’s a cloud-based solution that’s simple to set up, inexpensive, and easy to use.\nVoIP has advantages over PSTN, including lower network costs, faster connectivity, scalability, and advanced features, such as unified communications and app integrations.\nWhile PSTN calls aren’t as susceptible to security issues like cyber attacks, VoIP calls today have also become more safe and secure.\nPSTN vs. SIP # SIP means Session Initiation Protocol. It is a signaling protocol for communications ranging from voice and video calls to data transfers. SIP trunking is the direct connection and data routing from one phone to another between a business and an Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nVoIP systems don’t use dedicated lines. Instead, the data packets use routers and the internet. Each data packet travels through the least congested and shortest path that PSTNs aren’t smart enough to do.\nVoIP has many advantages over the PSTN:\nyou can create calling systems as simple or complex as your needs require, fitted with automations; conferencing capabilities; advanced privacy and security configurations; call recording, translation, transcription, and storage; integrations with other communications channels such as messaging or video; and much more—all on a network that is built to scale. With SIP, complexity is also reduced. You can start using it right away after set up as it doesn’t require hardware.\nPSTN vs. Hosted PBX # A hosted PBX or hosted phone system is a cloud-based solution that connects your phone system to the cloud, giving you all the benefits of a VoIP system while still offering you the use of traditional phone systems and hardware. With this alternative, you no longer worry about set-up, installation, and maintenance fees.\nPSTN vs. ISDN # Both PSTN and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) carry voice over traditional copper-based telephone lines or fiber optic cables but with some inherent differences.\nPSTN ISDN Traditional analog phone system Digital telecommunications system Supports basic voice calls and limited data services such as faxing and dial-up internet connections Offers high-quality, faster, and reliable voice, data, and video transmission compared to PSTN Cheaper but fewer features offered Offers high-quality, faster, and more reliable voice, data, and video transmission compared to PSTN ISDNs aren’t used these days. It was one of the first forms of higher-speed internet in the days of dial-up.\nDefinitions # AIN - Advanced Intelligent Network ANSI - American National Standards Institute CAS - Channel Associated Signaling CCS - Common Channel Signaling CLASS - Custom Local-Area Signaling Services DPC - Destination Point Code is used to identify the message destination (this is key for the routing of the message on the SS7 network) ETSI - European Telecommunications Standards Institute GT - Global Title used as a directory number used as an alias for a physical network GTT - Global Title Translation is the conversion of the GT address into a physical address ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN-PRI - Integrated Services Digital NetworkPrimary Rate Interface ISUP - ISDN User Part ITU - International Telecommunication Union ITU-T - Telecommunication Standardization Sector Linkset - Links between two SPs are logically grouped for administrative and load-sharing reasons.

In my work, I have regularly encountered the nuances of storing textual information, from illegibly written text and messy layout and fonts in a Word document to the processing of streaming data\nIn 2008, the following story happened A Cellphone\u0026rsquo;s Missing Dot Kills Two People, Puts Three More in Jail\nOr how the Wubi Effect is affecting Chinese language\nThe Korean Writing System PDF\nAnd character Set Issues by A.J.

We often say “Unicode” when we mean “not ASCII”, but that’s silly since of course all of ASCII is also included in Unicode.\nThere are already plenty of introductions to Unicode floating around (wikipedia, nedbat, joel).\nUTF-8 is an encoding, a way of turning a sequence of codepoints into bytes. All Unicode codepoints can be encoded in UTF-8. ASCII is also an encoding, but only supports 128 characters, mostly English letters and punctuation.\nA character is a fairly fuzzy concept. Letters and numbers and punctuation are characters. But so are Braille and frogs and halves of flags. Basically a thing in the Unicode table somewhere.\nUnicode refers to these numbers as code points.\nSince everybody in the world agrees on which numbers correspond to which characters, and we all agree to use Unicode, we can read each other’s texts.\nCurrently, the largest defined code point is 0x10FFFF. That gives us a space of about 1.1 million code points.\nAbout 170,000, or 15%, are currently defined. An additional 11% are reserved for private use. The rest, about 800,000 code points, are not allocated at the moment. They could become characters in the future.\nHere’s roughly how it looks:\nPrivate Use? # These are code points reserved for app developers and will never be defined by Unicode itself.\nFor example, there’s no place for the Apple logo in Unicode, so Apple puts it at U+F8FF which is within the Private Use block. In any other font, it’ll render as missing glyph 􀣺, but in fonts that ship with macOS, you’ll see .\nPrinciples of the Unicode Standard # The Unicode Standard set forth the following fundamental principles:\nUniversal repertoire - Every writing system ever used shall be respected and represented in the standard Logical order - In bidirectional text are the characters stored in logical order, not in a way that the representaion Efficiency - The documentation must be efficient and complete. Unification - Where different cultures or languages use the same character, it shall be only included once. This point is Characters, not glyphs - Only characters, not glyphs shall be encoded. In a nutshell, glyphs are the actual graphical Dynamic composition - New characters can be composed of other, already standardized characters. For example, the character “Ä” can be composed of an “A” and a dieresis sign (“ ¨ ”). Semantics - Included characters must be well defined and distinguished from others. Stability - Once defined characters shall never be removed or their codepoints reassigned. In the case of an error, a codepoint shall be deprecated.

Unicode actually has three cases. There’s lowercase, and there’s uppercase. And there’s titlecase.\nA character is uppercase if its general category is Lu (“Letter, uppercase”), and lowercase if its general category is Ll (“Letter, lowercase”). The Unicode Standard admits this is a very limiting definition, because each character gets only one general category, so many characters which “should be” uppercase or lowercase may fail this definition on account of their general category indicating something else. A character is uppercase if it has the derived property Uppercase, and lowercase if it has the derived property Lowercase. These are based on combining the characters in definition (1) with characters possessing other properties which indicate case. A character is uppercase if applying the Unicode case mapping to uppercase (“uppercasing it”) leaves it unchanged, and lowercase if applying the Unicode case mapping to lowercase (“lowercasing it”) leaves it unchanged. This is comprehensive, but may also behave unintuitively (see later sections). Meanwhile some characters have no case\nA character C is defined to be cased if and only if C has the Lowercase or Uppercase property or has a General_Category value of Titlecase_Letter.\nSome characters may appear to have multiple cases\nRead more in Falsehoods about case\nCase is context-locale-sensitive\nString length is typically determined by counting codepoints. This means that surrogate pairs would count as two characters. Combining multiple diacritics may be stacked over the same character. a + ̈ == ̈a , increasing length, while only producing a single character.\nSimilarily, reversing strings often is a non-trivial task. Again, surrogate pairs and diacritics must be reversed together. ES Reverser provides a pretty good solution.\nUpper and lower case mappings are not always one-to-one. They can also be:\nOne-to-many: (ß → SS ) Contextual: (…Σ ↔ …ς AND …ΣΤ… ↔ …στ… ) Locale-sensitive: ( I ↔ ı AND İ ↔ i )\nDo not forget about text rendering # Text Rendering Hates You\nMore Reading # More Awesome-Unicode\nW.T.F.

Regional models on the other hand have much higher resolutions, but only cover some part (region) of the globe, and only provide forecasts a couple days out in time.\nIn addition, all weather models, one way or another, compete for accuracy — or rather, meteorologists who work with them: they share the results and write scientific articles about it\u0026hellip; Europeans are believed to be better at predicting weather in temperate latitudes. Americans are slightly better at predicting weather in tropical latitudes because they have hurricanes, but this is debatable.\nWhy weather models sometimes give inaccurate weather forecasts?\nIn short, in general, we just can’t measure the weather absolutely accurately.\nGlobal # ECMWF (European Centre for medium-range weather forecasts) # ECMWF weather model (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) Resolution: various (14 km)\nForecast depth: 10 days Step: 3 hours Updates frequency: 2 times/day The ECMWF is a European global forecast seamless model and it is widely regarded as the best and most reliable model currently in existence. It uses a concept called 4D, which is an assimilation that allows the model to be constantly updated as new satellite or other input data becomes available. It is a well-known fact that the ECMWF was the only model that accurately predicted where Hurricane Sandy was moving.\nGFS (Global Forecast System) # GFS is a National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather forecast model that generates data for dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables, including temperatures, winds, precipitation, soil moisture, and atmospheric ozone concentration. The system couples four separate models (atmosphere, ocean model, land/soil model, and sea ice) that work together to accurately depict weather conditions.\nResolution: 27 km Forecast depth: 10 days Step: 1 hour Updates frequency: 4 times/day The GFS is the most well-known global weather model and it’s updated every six hours by the American meteorological service. It is actually made up of 4 separate models which work together to paint an accurate picture of weather conditions: atmospheric, ocean, land/soil and sea ice models. However, it doesn’t take topography and shapes of coastlines into account, so it isn’t very accurate for places next to bodies of water. Good for oceans.\nThe GFS+ is another version of the same model. While the standard GFS27 interpolates data for each point of the 27 km x 27 km square, the GFS+ version always shows the maximum value in each square.\nICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) # ICON\nResolution: various (Europe 7km, ICON7), (global 13km, ICON13) Forecast depth: 5,1 day Step: 1 hour Updates frequency: 4 times/day Created by the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst), the ICON is generally considered to be even more accurate than the ECMWF due to the better resolution, albeit only in Europe. The most important variables of the ICON are considered to be air density and virtual potential temperature, horizontal and vertical wind speed, humidity, cloud water, cloud ice, rain and snow. Its small-scale part includes the COSMO model, which will be fully integrated into the ICON by 2020.\nAt present, the model runs for forecast data distribution are at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC. The forecast horizon is +180 hours for the two model runs at 00 and 12 UTC and +120 hours for the other two runs at 06 and 18 UTC. The time interval for the forecast period up to +78 hours is one hour, all other forecast periods beyond +81 hours are covered by a 3-hourly time interval.\nICON, ICON-EU and ICON-D2 are very good models and provide excellent results, so we are excited to use ICON-D2 for planning our Alpine adventures.\nUM weather model (Unifef Model) # The UM (Unified Model)[https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model], also often referred to as the UKMO, is a global model developed in the UK. This model runs every 12 hours, with its output running out to 3 days. Due to its resolution, the UKMET is the most reliable model for the United Kingdom. The global model is considered reliable, and is a base for some regional small-scale models (e.g. New Zealand).\nResolution: 1.5 km (UK), 10 km (Global) Forecast depth: 3 days Step: 3 hours Updates frequency: 2 times/day CFS weather model (Climate Forecast System) # The CFS is a global numerical model. It is produced by the US NOAA NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction). The model is based on 11 years of weather observations. On each calendar date, the straight average value, determined from the available 11 values, is in general composed of the following components: the true climatological annual cycle, meteorological noise, climatological noise, model noise. The model forecast period is 9 months. It may have poor prediction value, but looks useful for long-term planning.\nResolution: 108 km Forecast depth: 30 days Step: 6 hours Updates frequency: 4 times/day Local # WRF weather model (Weather Research and Forecasting) # The WRF was a result of a collaborative effort of several agencies and laboratories across the globe in the 1980s. It is a codebase for further forecast model processing. It is applicable globally and can take local geography and topography into account. It has a wide range of different physical parameters and demands vast resources to process.

In 2015, the consortium initiated a partnership with the HIRLAM, with a goal of an integrated management of the two models. Besides the so-called ALADIN model, it has developed the global ARPEGE (55 km grid) and the regional AROME (1.25 km) for France and domains. These two are considered as good ‘chemical’ models, as they take into account chemical additives. The AROME has a very good resolution, thus taking into account many weather parameters, which makes it reliable in Europe.\nResolution: various GEM weather model (Global Environmental Multiscale Model) # GEM In North America, this model is often referred to as the CMC (Canadian Meteorological Centre) model.

The term shanty most accurately refers to a specific style of work song belonging to this historical repertoire. However, in recent, popular usage, the scope of its definition is sometimes expanded to admit a wider range of repertoire and characteristics, or to refer to a \u0026ldquo;maritime work song\u0026rdquo; in general.\nRecords of work songs are as old as historical records, and anthropological evidence suggests that most agrarian societies tend to have them. Most modern commentators on work songs have included both songs sung while working as well as songs about work since the two categories are seen as interconnected. Norm Cohen divided collected work songs into domestic, agricultural or pastoral, sea shanties, African-American work songs, songs and chants of direction, and street cries. Ted Gioia further divided agricultural and pastoral songs into hunting, cultivation and herding songs, and highlighted the industrial or proto-industrial songs of cloth workers (see Waulking song), factory workers, seamen, lumberjacks, cowboys and miners. He also added prisoner songs and modern work songs.\nBooks # Cecil Sharps English Folk-Chanteys (1914) was one of the first large collections of shanties made by a non-sailor and according to the methods of folklore.

Short notes # Fortified wines are fortified by the addition of extra alcohol in the form of brandy or spirits to bring them up to an alcohol content of 18%–20%. Porto, Sherry, Madeira, Marsala, and Vermouth are all fortified wines. If the extra alcohol is added after fermentation, a dry fortified wine such as Sherry is the outcome. Adding the alcohol during fermentation results in a sweet wine such as Porto.\nSherry: This fortified wine is produced in the Jerez region of Spain and is made from the Palomino, Muscat, or Pedro Ximénez grape. Sherry production is unique in that the winemaker intentionally exposes the wine to oxygen, which imparts a nutty and briny flavor profile. Before bottling, entire barrels are blended with portions of older wines. This is known as the solera method and is almost entirely exclusive to sherry. Sherry, like vermouth, is fortified with brandy and typically clocks in at around 15 to 18 percent alcohol by volume. Like any wine, it should be refrigerated but will retain its freshness about four times as long as a typical wine. There are many styles of sherry, ranging from the lighter fino style to the darker oloroso style. For those seeking an especially sweet drink, try a Pedro Ximénez sherry. The types of Spanish Sherry are Fino, which is the lightest, most delicate and some say driest of the Spanish Sherries. Served chilled with Tapas appetizers Manzanilla, which is also very dry, has a salty taste because it is aged in barrels placed outdoors on the beach where the sea air penetrates the porous wood Amontillado, which tastes more medium-dry to me, has a pronounced nutty flavor that makes it perfect in and with soups Oloroso, which means beautiful aroma, is dry but a richer, fuller-bodied style of Sherry Palo Cortado, is a rare type of Fino that loses its flor yeast and acquires a character between Amontillado and Oloroso Cream, which is the sweetest type of Sherry, is suitable on its own after dinner, or with dessert Port wine: Port wine hails from Portugal, and specifically, the Duoro Valley. Grapes must be grown and processed in the region, and to become port, the wine is fortified with unaged brandy before fermentation is complete to yield a product with around 20 percent ABV. Those seeking a different type of dessert wine might consider a white port, rosé port, ruby port, or tawny port. Porto is classified as Vintage Porto only in the declared great vintage years of exceptional quality.\nVermouth: Vermouth is an aromatized wine, which is a subcategory of fortified wines flavored with fruits, herbs, spices, and florals. Dry vermouth, sometimes referred to as French vermouth, has a distinctly crisp and floral character. Dry vermouth is produced by blending white wine with herbs and spices before adding brandy for fortification, and it’s an essential building block of the classic Martini. Sweet vermouth, sometimes referred to as Italian vermouth, has a heavier mouthfeel and a more caramelized, fruity character than dry vermouth. It doesn’t have to be made from red wine, although some producers insist on it. Sweet vermouth finds its home in countless classics like the Manhattan and Negroni, but it can also be enjoyed on its own with a bit of ice or soda.\nMadeira: Madeira hails from Portugal’s Madeira Islands. Madeira is usually a varietal wine named after the white grape variety used to make it. The five types of Madeira are\nSercial, the driest type, used in Beef Wellington recipes and sauces for main courses and soups. Verdelho, called Verdejo in Spain, has slightly more body, color and richness, but is still very dry. Bual, which is very similar to Verdelho, is also considered a dry style of Madeira. Rainwater, which is a blend of varietals, is light and medium-dry in style and first became popular among America’s founding fathers at the time of the 13 original colonies. Malmsey, the sweetest type, is made from the Malvasia grape and is used in the dessert called English Trifle, which consists of layers of cake, pudding, and fruit. Marsala: Marsala comes from Marsala, a city on the Italian island of Sicily. The wine is classified by age, color, and sweetness levels, as measured by grams of residual sugar per liter. It is available in both dry and sweet varieties. Marsala is produced using white Italian grapes and, depending on its type, contains between 15 and 20 percent alcohol by volume. The various types of Marsalas are classified depending on their sweetness, age, and color.\nMoscatel de Setúbal: This a Portuguese fortified wine that comes from the municipality of Setúbal. Guidelines specify that it must be made with at least 85 percent Muscat white grapes and contain between 16 and 22 percent ABV.\nCommandaria: It’s made with only two types of grapes, xynisteri and mavro, which are indigenous to the island. It’s said to have a history of production stretching back nearly 3,000 years. Maximum alcohol content is 20 percent ABV, and the wine’s taste is highly rich, sweet, and fruity.\nGwaha-ju Gwaha-ju is a fortified rice wine made in Korea.Although rice wine is not made from grapes, it has a similar alcohol content to grape wine, and the addition of the distilled spirit, soju, and other ingredients like ginseng, jujubes, ginger, etc., to the rice wine, bears similarity to the above-mentioned fortified wines.\nPick a Perfect Wine In No Time book https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=421051\u0026seqNum=6 https://www.eater.com/wine/22252382/fortified-wine-vermouth-sherry-madeira-martini-negroni https://www.masterclass.com/articles/complete-guide-to-fortified-wine https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/a-guide-to-fortified-wines-and-how-to-drink-them https://punchdrink.com/articles/natural-wines-new-frontiers-andalucia-spain-hokkaido-japan/\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/AN/C4AN02390K#!divAbstract - A sniffer-camera for imaging of ethanol vaporization from wine: the effect of wine glass shape\nMore about wine Wine Folly winefolly.com/ vivino https://www.vivino.com/ More ratings https://www.winespectator.com/ratings More more ratings https://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-scores\n","date":"1 September 2023","permalink":"/posts/fortified_wine/","section":"Posts","summary":"Fortified wine.

You have to read body language, empathy, be a leader - weee\nWith a release date of late 2020-2022 (for the majority of the course). Online, remote, asynchronous communication, vr/ar/mr metaverse - have not heard.\nEI tips on the courses not just about politeness. its just post-post meta-meta language over the true. Feels like scald poem lang learning\nOkay. Okay.\nEmotional intelligence is crucial. I fully admit it. It is really important to understand other people\u0026rsquo;s point of view, to find a balance between empathy and responsibility, to demonstrate the ability to listen and respond appropriately to various verbal and non-verbal cues.\nBut sometimes I think it\u0026rsquo;s just learning the kind of poetry of the skalds and the alliterations and the \u0026ldquo;heiti\u0026quot;s and \u0026ldquo;kjenning\u0026quot;s Let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s just a language of its own.

And with this course, we are going to grow people who will support that culture.\u0026rdquo; I fully endorse some of the items. Like don\u0026rsquo;t be a dick. Act the way you want others to act around you.\nBut some of the things that are more like manipulation or hypnosis techniques (see the book \u0026ldquo;Have You Tried Hypnosis?\u0026rdquo;) for manipulation purposes are really pissing me off.\nSoft yes, please. Do a favor to reach your goal. Empathy (say hi to all neurodivergents in this chat). Just be comfortable for everyone around and do not show you opinion in the most effective way.\nF*ck\notherwise we\u0026rsquo;ll be an illustration to How to Build Toxic Software Teams: People want to get along.\nMost people, if they are shown some respect, will figure out a way to make peace with their coworkers. As the leader of a team wanting to create a toxic culture and have it still be going when you return from prison, you need to create a team that never reaches this peace.\nFoster a culture of inconsistent goals The definition of quality work should not be consistent and well-understood. Imagine that you are a working at a restaurant making soup, and a head chef decides if your soup is good enough everyday and you only get paid if it is. You make the soup the same everyday, but some days it isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. You start to imagine reasons - maybe the chef doesn\u0026rsquo;t like you, maybe someone is messing with your ingredients, maybe you don’t know what you are doing, maybe you have angered the soup God - the stress of this situation given the stakes will create a paranoid and uncollaborative workforce.\nThis is your goal - create a culture in which only your approval is a measure of good or bad. Make this approval infrequent and inconsistent. As soon as the soupmaker starts to feel empowered, spit out his soup. Occassionly say things like “this soup is OK, but Barbara doesn’t like it”. Extra points if there is no coworker named Barbara. This single action will kill any hopes of a team with ownership - after all, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough often enough they will never feel like it is their soup.\nDiscourage creativity If something goes wrong, start an investigation. Figure out who to blame and do it publically. Raise your voice, send nasty emails, mean-mug without delay. Anytime there is a failure, don\u0026rsquo;t miss an opportunity to assert your authority. Attach ideas to specific people, not to the team. The team may come up with an idea, but failure falls to one person.\nThis will prevent the team from trying new things and keep making soup while hoping for the best. Eventually, they will also get better at investigations than making food.\nGo away, then return with chaos If you lead the team, don\u0026rsquo;t show up. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell anybody. In general be very hard to reach. Move or cancel meetings, then show up late to the ones you do attend. Don’t let meetings start without you, then change the subject ten minutes after you arrive. Make it so that people simply do not know what you are about to say, then surprise them.\nPrepare the team for their next leader If you do these steps, the next leader will be easy to find - he or she can only be found from outside the team. Nobody left on the team can be head chef, they only know how to fearfully make crappy soup and run internal investigations. Congratulations - you have properly prepared the team for their next leader.\n","date":"20 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/small_hates/","section":"Posts","summary":"I would say a few words about communication courses # Techniques to improve the quality and speed of communication.

So we can hear a small pice, but not the whole work) Another example is \u0026ldquo;Traveler\u0026rdquo; by Dr Wesley Cray. It is an illustration of the idea of unworkable works. It has a score with sheet music in it. And a note on it says that the musician has to play 10 years back in time. back in time. Such a piece, in theory, could be performed in another universe.\nLogical Unperformability: # “Given logical constraints, there can be no genuine performances.” e.g. Tribute to I.F.

In particular, the possibility of these works raises serious problems for type-theoretic accounts of the ontology of music as well as certain mereological or constitution-based accounts.” see: \u0026ldquo;Unperformable Works and the Ontology of Music\u0026rdquo; (2016, British Journal of Aesthetics, 56(1): 67-81).

If nobody ever broke the once-established boundaries, music would stop changing. Writing unplayable music is also a trespass and the existence of such works is part and parcel of the development of music as an art.\nSome more useful links # \u0026ldquo;Genuine works of music\u0026rdquo; part of lecture Unperformable Works and the Ontology of Art ","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/demoscene_and_unperformable_music/","section":"Posts","summary":"Demoscene accepted as UNESCO cultural heritage in The Netherlands and topic about unperformable music # The Dutch inscription is continuing the success story of the demoscene as first digital culture accepted by the UNESCO.","title":"Demoscene as UNESCO cultural heritage and unperformable music"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#art"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#math/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#math"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#panic_attack/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#panic_attack"},{"content":"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh Mathematical artist in Qom, Iran.

How to\nGuide по ПА (нас попросили - мы написали)\nПаническая атака как единичное явление обычно бывает следствием проникновения в сознание некоторой пугающей и/или болезненной информации.\nОсновной мотив ПА - это страх и неизбежность/фатальность/предопределённость.\nОсновной симптом - учащение сердцебиения и дыхания и туннельное восприятие как следствие активации симпатической нервной системы.\nИными словами: организм воспринимает некоторую мысль как угрожающую жизни. Что, конечно же, неправда. От одной только мысли ещё никто не умирал.\nПричины таких реакций при желании можно найти и проанализировать самостоятельно или с терапевтом.\nСправиться с ПА в острой фазе можно двумя путями:\nФизиологический: глубоко и медленно дышать под счёт. Когнитивный: сказать себе: «Окей, у меня ПА. Это нормально, так бывает. Меня что-то напугало, я с этим разберусь, но объективно моей жизни и здоровью прямо сейчас ничего не угрожает». Ну да, выпить тоже скорее всего поможет, но это скользкая дорожка. Как помочь товарищу при ПА:\nНе паниковать самому. Спокойно ровно говорить что-то в духе: «Похоже у тебя ПА и тебя что-то испугало. Ты главное дыши: «Вдох-выдох». Я тут, я рядом, ты справишься, это пройдёт, все наладится, у меня тоже так было» и что-то ещё ровное умиротворяющее. Если знаете, что триггернуло и можете предложить решение - предложите. Если товарищ не реагирует на речь, задыхается и выглядит совсем плохо - спокойно ровно сказать, что ты хочешь помочь, поэтому сейчас вызываешь скорую. Скорее всего это приведёт к диалогу. Очень важно вести себя уверенно и доброжелательно, чтобы не испугать товарища ещё сильнее. Отвлечь/отвлечься на что угодно другое может помочь купировать ПА в моменте, но повышает риск рецидива, тк триггерящая информация в этом случае не будет усвоена сознанием, и с определённой вероятностью вызовет аналогичную реакцию в похожей ситуации в будущем. Оптимальный вариант, если физиология позволяет держать ручку/телефон - записывать все возникающие мысли - это очень помогает успокоиться, а также позволит проанализировать триггеры и лучше понять себя.\nlink # https://postnauka.org/faq/81304\n","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/ru/posts/panic_attack/","section":"ru Posts","summary":"Panic attack.

Will we ever understand biology like we currently understand physics*? My take is no (and it seems clear) but curious to hear other takes!\n* And: Once physics is complete (which I think will happen eventually), will biology ever have something that compares?\n\u0026mdash; José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente (@ArtirKel) November 9, 2021 The study of organisms looks no less complex than the study of distant space systems.\nAnd while the study of a collection of organ systems looks like a rather pessimistic undertaking, the study of a single system looks somewhat more rosy. At least the paper Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor? seems more optimistic than the paper Can a biologist fix a radio?—Or, what I learned while studying apoptosis\nOn the other hand, watching the AI in Drug Discovery but not being involved in the industry I cannot be super optimistic in this direction. We have many tools and experiments, research, papers, pre-prints \u0026hellip; but databases are not open\nI just like this lecture about stats https://youtu.be/hVimVzgtD6w?t=921. trash in-trash out. \u0026ldquo;we cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to start to analyse it. At most what is available is rare data from platforms like Kaggle, open reaction database, sometimes some other open data like enamine, chemify or a piece of data from services like drugbank.\nBut even this might not be [enough to allow AI tools to reach their full potential](https://jgreener64.github.io/posts/science_the_hard_way/#fnref:blog). The best possible training sets would also include data on negative outcomes, such as reaction conditions that don’t produce desired substances. And data need to be recorded in agreed and consistent formats, which they are not at present.\nIt is true that this is understandable for security reasons. But I would like to see something similar to \u0026ldquo;Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor\u0026rdquo; but on drug design or gerontology.\nSo, the main limitations, from my point of view, are:\nData. Data availability and quality (Will synetic data be a solution? one, two); little data on structures, tissues, targets, etc. Cultural and ethical limitations “No one ever realized it until now, but here’s a strong contender for the root cause of Disease X”. And that could lead to predictions like “So that means that inhibiting this particular kinase that no one has cared about until now should be a drug for the disease”, or (more likely) \u0026quot;If you can find some way to interfere with this pathway over here, that would attack Disease X at a key point\u0026quot;. That would be a very nice thing for software to tell us\nand\nSo at the moment, if you took any of the AI-generated molecules from these projects and showed them to an experienced medicinal chemist, the response would be \u0026quot;Well, yeah, sure\u0026quot;, and probably also \u0026quot;You'd better check to make sure those are actually patentable\u0026quot;. Did this computational approach speed things up, though? Wills' blog post mentions the number of compounds that the company says were actually synthesized in each of these three cases (350, 163, and 500, respectively). These are not at all out of line with what you would expect from doing a traditional fast-follower effort off of known chemical matter. It would be interesting to know if these were all synthesized from a first run of recommendations of the AI software, or if assay results were fed back in as the compounds appeared and were tested, but either way that seems to be a reasonable amount of SAR, given the fact that you're starting in well-studied chemical space. The time savings would come, though, if the software was able to direct synthesis in a way that you were sure that whatever you went to the trouble of making would also be in those areas of legally clear space.\nSo as far as I can tell, that's where we are now. But again, credit where it's due: these are early days, and it's going to be the easier problems that yield first. Right now, the AI stuff is working at the level of \u0026quot;Hey, here's a whole bunch of people working on Target X for Disease Y - is there any room for me in there?\u0026quot;. That of course doesn't get at the reasons why we still have nearly a 90% failure rate overall in the clinic in this business, which are that it turns generally out that Target X really isn't that useful against Disease Y, or that our compounds directed towards it do other things that we didn't expect. Those are the harder problems UPD:\nWhere is generative design in drug discovery today article said that Molecules that are generated today can satisfy relevant ranges for physicochemical properties like molecular weight, logP, or logD, and pass through MedChem and PAINS filters.

A lot of people looked at France, and what went on there after the french revolution in 1789. In 1793 the French invaded The Netherlands, and the Netherlands became a vassal state of the French empire. This also meant that our laws changed to French laws, or the ‘code Napoléon’.\nIn 1811 Civil Registration was introduced in the entire Netherlands. A public record where all births, deaths and marriages were recorded. (The southern part of the Netherlands has had this since 1796). This also meant that a family name had to be registered. Most of the time, people were addressed with their first name, followed by the first name of (mostly) their father, followed by the suffix -son or -daughter.\nThis would however pose a problem with the new Civil Registry. For example, the father\u0026rsquo;s surname may be different from the son\u0026rsquo;s surname. For example, Jan\u0026rsquo;s father\u0026rsquo;s name is Karel. Thus his name would be Jana Karelsun. Jan has a son called Pete. His full name would be Pete Jansun. Thus, there were no surnames in the strict sense of the word.\nNote that this way of naming people is/was quite common throughout Europe, and is still used in some countries, Iceland being an example.\nIn 1811 ppl from the Netherlands were required by law to register themselves in the Civil Registry. Every family would have the same family name. Sometimes people would choose the name the father familias was already known for, which is why the family names ‘Jansen’ (from Janszoon) and ‘Pietersen’ (from Peterszoon) are so common.\nOften, people would choose their profession as a family name. ‘Bakker’ if they were a baker, ‘Visser’ (fisherman) or ‘de Ruyter’ (for a cavalerist).\nSometimes people would choose a funny name, maybe because they wanted to protest these new, pedantic rules from the French a little… so you would get family names like ‘Potjebier’ (glass of beer), ‘Zondergeld’ (without money) and ‘Goedemoed’ (in good spirits) or ‘de Man’, which translates literally into ‘the man’.\nSome more example:\nNaaktgeboren (“born naked”) - Weren\u0026rsquo;t we all? Van Lul (“from the dick”) - yep, we’re all from there. Van Kut (“from the pussy”) - I’d like to introduce you to my friend above… In t’ veld (“in the field”) - well, I suppose we know where your ancestors were when last names were given Niemantsverdriet (“never caused harm”) - I’d like to be that guy’s neighbor! Pijpers (“suckers”, the verb, not adjective :) - I realize that wasn’t the meaning back then… but it kinda is now Doodeman (“dead man”) - I am Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die! Geldmaker (“money maker”) - Dad, is that you? Sta van Uiter (“standing outside”) - will someone please let the guy in!? Hoeren (“hookers”) - Would you mind introducing me to your sisters? Eijkelhardt (“hard prick”) - are you the husband of Ms. Hookers? De Jode (“the Jew”) - I actually know a Catholic priest with that last name. I kid you not! Then again, Jesus was a Jew too! De Koe (“the cow”) - Are you sure you want another piece of that stroopwafel? Zuinig (“cheap / frugal”) - I guess I’ll be paying for dinner then… Zweep (“whip”) - Hey baby, I’ve been a naughty boy.

The first is the routine METAR report that is transmitted every hour. The second is a special report, a SPECI, that can be given at any time to update the METAR for rapidly changing weather conditions, aircraft mishaps, or other critical information. So here, it’ll say either METAR or SPECI.\nStation id K refers to the Continental United States. The three letters after it CLE, refers to the airport. In this case, Cleveland Hopkins Airport.\nA four-letter code as established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 48 contiguous states, a unique three-letter identifier is preceded by the letter “K.” For example, Gregg County Airport in Longview, Texas, is identified by the letters “KGGG,” K being the country designation and GGG being the airport identifier. In other regions of the world, including Alaska and Hawaii, the first two letters of the four-letter ICAO identifier indicate the region, country, or state. Alaska identifiers always begin with the letters “PA,” and Hawaii identifiers always begin with the letters “PH.” A list of station identifiers can be found here.\nDate and time of report Depicted in a six-digit group (161753Z). The first two digits refers to the day of the month. The next 4 digits 0136 refers to the time when the report was made. The Z refers to ZULU or UTC time. A “Z” is appended to the end of the time to denote that the time is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed to local time. If you ever need to convert UTC/Zulu time to your local time, here’s an online conversion tool: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc\nModifier Sometimes the METAR will have a COR or AUTO modifier after the Date \u0026amp; Time. COR indicates a corrected observation. Disregard the previous transmission. COR 1725 means that the correction was transmitted at 1725Z. AUTO a refers to an automated observation with measurements taken by equipment such as the domestic Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) or Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS), or the Air Force’s Automated Meteorological Station (AMS), also known as AN/FMQ-19. AO1 denotes an observation taken by equipment lacking a precipitation type discriminator (rain vs. snow). AO2 denotes an observation taken by standard equipment with a full complement of sensors. A02A denotes an automated observation augmented by a human observer.\nWind Reported with five numbers (14021), unless the speed is greater than 99 knots, in which case the wind is reported with six numbers.( If you see six numbers, you probably don’t want to be operating a UAS.)\nThe first three digits 310 is the direction of the wind in degrees in relation to TRUE North. If the wind is variable, then “VRB” will go after the numbers. (Example: 090V180) The second numbers 06 mean refer to the wind speed in knots. If gusts are present, the next two or three digits following the “G” are the “gust,” the maximum wind speed in the last ten minutes.\nFor example 25015G30KT - wind is blowing from 250 degrees (true) at a sustained speed of 15 knots with 30-knot gusts.\nWind direction, N=0, E=90, S=180, W=270\n5.1 Wing varying between directions A wind variability group will be reported if the wind is variable by 60 degrees or more and the speed is greater than 6 knots. This remark will contain the extremes of the wind directions, separated by “V.” For example METAR KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034 Where 210V290 - wind direction varying between 210 and 290.\nVisibility This refers to the visibility. For example 10SM = is 10 Statute Miles, 3/4 SM = ¾ of a mile. The largest reportable metric value is 9999. This value represents a visibility greater than 9000 meters (7 SM or more). 6.1 Runway Visual Range Runway Visual Range (RVR) follows the visibility and begins with the letter “R.” The runway heading will follow the “R,”. The last four digits report the visibility in feet.\nFor example, 32L/1000FT = runway visual range for runway 32 Left is 1,000 ft.\nAt overseas locations, visibility is reported in meters, and FT is omitted from the RVR group. The same RVR at an overseas location would appear as R32L/0300 and read, “runway visual range for 32 Left is 300 meters.”\nM0600FT = “RVR is less than 600 feet.” (M = less than) P6000FT = “RVR is greater than 6,000feet.” (P = greater than) R06L2000V4000FT = “RVR for 6 Left is variable between 2,000 and 4,000 feet.” “V” indicates that the RVR is variable between two thresholds.\n6.2 Present Weather and Obscurations (If any) In our METAR report, this isn\u0026rsquo;t included, but let\u0026rsquo;s use +SHRA. The + means Heavy, SH means Showers and RA means Rain. Look at the legend below for the full list of possibilities.\nPhenomenon Qualifiers\nIntensity: (-): Light ( ): Moderate [No prefix] (+): Heavy\nProximity: VC: In the vicinity none: On station\nDescriptor: MI: Shallow BC: Patches DR: Low Drifting BL: Blowing SH: Showers TS: Thunderstorm FZ: Freezing PR: Partial\nTypes of Weather Phenomenon Precipitation: DZ: Drizzle RA: Rain SN: Snow SG: Snow Grains IC: Ice Crystals PL: Ice Pellets GR: Hail GS: Small Hail \u0026amp;/or Snow Pellets UP: Unknown Precipitation\nObscuration: BR: Mist FG: Fog FU: Smoke VA: Volcanic Ash DU: Widespread Dust SA: Sand HZ: Haze PY: Spray\nOther: PO: Well-Developed Dust/Sand Whirls SQ: Squalls FC: Funnel Cloud Tornado Waterspout SS: Sandstorm DS: Duststorm\nSky condition The next block means the sky conditions. The first three letters FEW are the codes for the amount of coverage in the sky. Sky coverage in eighths: NCD: No Cloud Detected (note that laiser ceilometer check directly above the sensor) SKC: SKy Clear (Manual report) CLR: CLeaR (Automated report) FEW: Few \u0026ndash; 0-2 eighths (1/8 to 1/4 of the sky covered) SCT: Scattered \u0026ndash; 3-4 eighths (3/8 to 1/2 of the sky covered) BKN: * Broken \u0026ndash; 5-7 eighths (5/8 to 7/8 of the sky covered) OVC: * Overcast \u0026ndash; 8 eighths (Total sky coverage)\nThe next three digits 020 mean the amount of feet (in hundreds) in which the clouds are located.\nIn this first part, we’re seeing the height of the cloud base, which is being reported with a three-digit number in hundreds of feet above-ground-level (AGL). BKN stands for broken clouds, and “008” means 800 feet. So the cloud base is at 800 feet AGL. That’s one thing that’s happening. Then we’re also seeing OVC, which stands for overcast, and the “012” stands for 1,200 ft. So we have overcast clouds at 1,200 ft. AGL. And we’re seeing the type of cloud here too. CB stands for cumulonimbus clouds, and another indicator you might see here is TCU, which stands for towering cumulus clouds.\nTemperature and dew point For example - 22/21 The first two digits 22 represent the temperature in Celsius. The second two digits 21 represent the dewpoint in Celsius. To display negative numbers, there will be an M in front of the numbers (Example M04/02 = -04 degress C/ dewpoint: 2).\nAltimeter setting A2984 - A Represents \u0026ldquo;Altimeter\u0026rdquo;. 2984 represents 29.84 inches of mercury for the pressure.\nQ1011 represents a current altimeter setting of 1011 hPa or 1011 mb. The 5-character group beginning with Q, following the temperature/dewpoint group is the altimeter setting in hectopascals (hPa), used in some overseas locations. A hectopascal is equivalent to a millibar (mb).\nRemarks The remarks section always begins with the letters “RMK.” Comments may or may not appear in this section of the METAR. The information contained in this section may include wind data, variable visibility, beginning and ending times of particular phenomenon, pressure information, and various other information deemed necessary. In the above example, PRESFR means “pressure falling rapidly”. Another example of a remark regarding weather phenomenon that does not fit in any other category would be: OCNL LTGICCG. This translates as occasional lightning in the clouds and from cloud to ground. Automated stations also use the remarks section to indicate the equipment needs maintenance. The remarks section I use to \u0026lsquo;decode\u0026rsquo; the metar remarks is on dixwx.com, and use their abbreviations chart for more in-depth information.

It also stands for the first letter of the word ‘Europe’ in the Latin alphabet, while the two parallel lines running through the symbol signify stability.\nCheck out the previous version of the eurobills had designed euro in latin and also in greek but the new version also has it in cyrillic euro why is it so well because in 2007 Bulgaria joined the EU and they put the sign euro on the bills in Cyrillic even though Bulgaria is not yet in the euro area.\n","date":"4 March 2023","permalink":"/posts/euro/","section":"Posts","summary":"Euro\nApart from the story of the euro country and the eurozone and the euro area, the widespread move to online payment and the minimisation of the cache, there are some interesting facts about the euro notes","title":"Euro"},{"content":"Yayoi Kusama\nhttp://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/\nOne of the world\u0026rsquo;s most famous dotty artists\nStory of Yayoi Kusama A track for inspiration ","date":"21 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/yayoikusama/","section":"Posts","summary":"Yayoi Kusama\nhttp://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/\nOne of the world\u0026rsquo;s most famous dotty artists\nStory of Yayoi Kusama A track for inspiration ","title":"Euro"},{"content":" How to discover history with Mudlarks? https://www.instagram.com/mudlark_mud_god/ http://www.thamesandfield.com/\nhttps://www.pla.co.uk/Environment/Thames-foreshore-permits\n","date":"21 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/mudlarks/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to discover history with Mudlarks? https://www.instagram.com/mudlark_mud_god/ http://www.thamesandfield.com/\nhttps://www.pla.co.uk/Environment/Thames-foreshore-permits","title":"How to discover history with Mudlarks?

Data is broken up into smaller pieces (called packets), sent over a network, then put back together. Iptables identifies the packets received and then uses a set of rules to decide what to do with them.\nIptables filters packets based on:\nTables: Tables are files that join similar actions. A table consists of several chains. Chains: A chain is a string of rules. When a packet is received, iptables finds the appropriate table, then runs it through the chain of rules until it finds a match. Rules: A rule is a statement that tells the system what to do with a packet. Rules can block one type of packet, or forward another type of packet. The outcome, where a packet is sent, is called a target. Targets: A target is a decision of what to do with a packet. Typically, this is to accept it, drop it, or reject it (which sends an error back to the sender). Tables and Chains # Linux firewall iptables has four default tables.\n1. Filter # The Filter table is the most frequently used one. It acts as a bouncer, deciding who gets in and out of your network. It has the following default chains:\nInput – the rules in this chain control the packets received by the server. Output – this chain controls the packets for outbound traffic. Forward – this set of rules controls the packets that are routed through the server. 2. Network Address Translation (NAT) # This table contains NAT (Network Address Translation) rules for routing packets to networks that cannot be accessed directly. When the destination or source of the packet has to be altered, the NAT table is used. It includes the following chains:\nPrerouting – this chain assigns packets as soon as the server receives them. Output – works the same as the output chain we described in the filter table. Postrouting – the rules in this chain allow making changes to packets after they leave the output chain. 3. Mangle # The Mangle table adjusts the IP header properties of packets. The table has all the following chains we described above:\nPrerouting Postrouting Output Input Forward 4. Raw # The Raw table is used to exempt packets from connection tracking. The raw table has two of the chains we previously mentioned:\nPrerouting Output 5. Security (Optional) # Some versions of Linux also use a Security table to manage special access rules. This table includes\ninput output forward chains, much like the filter table.\nTargets # A target is what happens after a packet matches a rule criteria. Non-terminating targets keep matching the packets against rules in a chain even when the packet matches a rule.\nWith terminating targets, a packet is evaluated immediately and is not matched against another chain. The terminating targets in Linux iptables are:\nAccept – this rule accepts the packets to come through the iptables firewall. Drop – the dropped package is not matched against any further chain. When Linux iptables drop an incoming connection to your server, the person trying to connect does not receive an error. It appears as if they are trying to connect to a non-existing machine. Return – this rule sends the packet back to the originating chain so you can match it against other rules. Reject – the iptables firewall rejects a packet and sends an error to the connecting device. Basic Syntax for iptables Commands and Options # General looks like\nsudo iptables [option] CHAIN_rule [-j target] A list of some common iptables options:\n–A ––append – Add a rule to a chain (at the end). –C ––check – Look for a rule that matches the chain’s requirements. –D ––delete – Remove specified rules from a chain. –F ––flush – Remove all rules. –I ––insert – Add a rule to a chain at a given position. –L ––list – Show all rules in a chain. –N ––new–chain – Create a new chain. –v ––verbose – Show more information when using a list option. –X ––delete–chain – Delete the provided chain. Iptables is case-sensitive, so make sure you’re using the correct options.\nCurrent iptables Status\niptables -L Enable Loopback Traffic\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –i lo –j ACCEPT Allow Traffic on Specific Ports: To allow HTTP web traffic, enter the following command:\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –p tcp ––dport 80 –j ACCEPT To allow only incoming SSH (Secure Shell) traffic, enter the following:\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –p tcp ––dport 22 –j ACCEPT To allow HTTPS internet traffic, enter the following command:\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –p tcp ––dport 443 –j ACCEPT –p – Check for the specified protocol (tcp). ––dport – Specify the destination port. –j jump – Take the specified action. Control Traffic by IP Address\nACCEPT traffic from a specific IP address.\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –s 192.168.0.27 –j ACCEPT DROP traffic from an IP address:\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –s 192.168.0.27 –j DROP REJECT traffic from a range of IP addresses, but the command is more complex:\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –m iprange ––src–range 192.168.0.1–192.168.0.255 -j REJECT –m – Match the specified option. –iprange – Tell the system to expect a range of IP addresses instead of a single one. ––src-range – Identifies the range of IP addresses. Dropping Unwanted Traffic\nsudo iptables –A INPUT –j DROP Delete a Rule You can use the –F option to clear all iptables firewall rules. A more precise method is to delete the line number of a rule.\nFirst, list all rules by entering the following:\nsudo iptables –L ––line–numbers sudo iptables –D INPUT \u0026lt;Number\u0026gt; Save rules sudo /sbin/iptables–save or sudo /sbin/service iptables save\n","date":"27 May 2019","permalink":"/posts/iptables_notes/","section":"Posts","summary":"Iptables # One of the utility firewall developed for Linux systems is iptables.\nHow iptables Work # Network traffic is made up of packets.

(This is the “pun” referred to by guillermo chamorro\u0026rsquo;s second comment to the question.) Perhaps one reason why people like the joke so much is that the statement can be understood in three different ways, and so there isn\u0026rsquo;t any clarity about which way is meant. Yet, all three of the ways are accurate, at least on some operating systems. (Point #2 might not apply to Ubuntu, and I do understand that this is an Ubuntu-focused site. However, Ubuntu derives from Debian wish has strong history of ideas being taken from, and shared with, the rest of Unix and Unix-ish systems. So, understanding what other operating systems do isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing.)\nmore is the oldest, less is an improvement and most is an improvement on that.\nShort comparison:\nmore: forward navigation and limited backward navigation.\nless: both forward and backward navigation and also has search options. You can go to the beginning and the end of a file instantly. Plus you can switch to an editor (like open the file in vi or vim). It is noticeably quicker than editor for when the file is large. The less command supports a shell/environment variable named LESS_IS_MORE. The less command acts quite a bit like the older more command by default, but if the less command sees this variable is set to a value of 1 (the number one), then the less command will offer fewer features in an attempt to be increase just how compatible it is with the older pager command that is named more.\nmost: has all the features of more and less but you can also open multiple files, close 1 file at a time when you have multiple files open, allows locking and scrolling of the open windows and allows for splitting of open windows.\nUPD: bat as cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.\nLinks: # https://askubuntu.com/questions/1191862/what-is-the-difference-between-more-and-less-commands\n","date":"27 May 2019","permalink":"/posts/more_less_most/","section":"Posts","summary":"more vs less vs most # There is an old joke consisting of three words: “less is more”.

Это безопасное соединение, которое гарантирует, что информация которая передается от вашего браузера на сервер остается приватной; то есть защищенной от хакеров или любого, кто хочет украсть информацию. Один из самых распространенных примеров использования SSL — это защита клиента во время онлайн транзакции (покупки товара, оплаты).\nСтоит учитывать, что использование https, за счет шифрования, дешифрования, проверок сертификата отнимает немного больше ресурсов и требует больше времени на соединение, по сравнению с http. Неправильно настроеный - 4 роунд рип правильно - 1 раунтрип в firefox и старая opera Выход - типизация проверок. scsp srrl - проверки на валидность.\nСам по себе SSL сертификат представляет собой цифровую подпись, в которой содержится следующая информация: полное (уникальное) имя владельца сертификата открытый ключ владельца дата выдачи ssl сертификата дата окончания сертификата (может выдаваться как на год, так и на несколько лет) полное (уникальное) имя центра сертификации\nSSL - как работает # Прежде чем начать работу, пользователю, владедьцу сервера необходимо послать запрос на получение того или иного сертификата в центр сертификации (Certification authority), или же сгенерировать его самостоятельно. Он отправляет запрос, сгенерированый открытый ключ и идентификационную информацию. В ответ пользователь получает сам сертификат, и открытый ключ, подписанный закрытым ключом CA. После получения ответа, пользователь помещает цифровой сертификат в базу сертификатов своего веб-сервера.\nПосле уже начинается взаимодействие сервера, получившего сертификат, с пользователем.\nМеханизм выглядит следующим образом:\nПользователь генерирует запрос к серверу и автоматически скачивает сертификат. Браузер пользователя определяет можно ли доверять центру сертификации, подписавшиму сертификат. Пользователь отправляет серверу сессионный ключ, зашифрованый открытым ключем сертификата. Сервер дешифрует сообщение пользователя закрытым ключем Таким образом выполняется одно из основных правил криптографии - аутентификации. То есть поддтверждения, что данные поступают именно от того и тому, кому преднозначены.\nSSL и браузеры # Для корректной работы к браузеру пользователя так же применяются определенные требования:\nБраузер пользователя должен знать о CA и доверять ему. Сертификат CA должен быть установлен в браузере (либо в корневых сертификатах утройства, если брайзер использует их). Причины по которым браузер может посчитать Ваш сертификат недействительным # Срок действия сертификата CA истек. Обновление сертификатов происходит при обновлении браузера. Ключ шифрования CA был скомпроментирован, а корневой сертификат отозван. В браузере, по каким либо причинам отсутствует информация о CA SSL - каким бывает # SSL сертификаты бывают нескольких типов и видов.\nСамоподписной сертификат. Его можно сгенерировать прямо на веб-сервере. Также, во всех самых популярных панелях управления хостингом (Cpanel, ISPmanager, Directadmin) возможность сгенерировать сертификат доступна по умолчанию. Однако у такого сертификата есть и свои минусы. В частости, все браузеры будут выдавать ошибку, с предупреждением, о том, что сайт не проверен.\nСуществует разделение сертификатов по виду того, что они поддтверждают.\nСертификаты, которые подтверждают только доменное имя (Domain Validation — DV). Сертификаты, которые подтверждают домен и организацию (Organization Validation — OV). Сертификаты, с расширенной проверкой (Extendet Validation — EV). Это те самые сертификаты с расширенной проверки и зеленой строкой в браузере, о которых мы говорили выше. Получить их может только юридическое лицо, коммерческая, некоммерческая или государственная организация. Далее идет разделение сертификатов на те, которые поддтверждают один иимеют ли несколько вышеперечисленных пунктов, поддерживают национальные языки (это, например, кириллические домены), повышенный уровень шифрования и т. п.\nОбычные SSL сертификаты. # Тут все понятно, это сертификаты, которые выпускаются автоматически и подтверждают только домен. Подходят для всех сайтов.\nSGC сертификаты # Сертификаты с поддержкой повышения уровня шифрования. Актуально для очень старых браузеров, которые поддерживали только 40 или 56 бит шифрование. При использовании этого сертификата уровень шифрования принудительно повышается до 128 бит. Однако, вопрос в необходимости этих сертификатов - открыт.\nWildcard сертификаты # Нужны в том случае, когда вам кроме основного домена нужно обеспечить шифрование также на всех поддоменах одного домена. Например: есть домен domain.com и вам нужно установить такой же сертификат на support.domain.com, forum.domain.com и billing.domain.com\nSAN сертификаты\nПригодится, если вы хотите использовать один сертификат для нескольких разных доменов. Например, daomain.com, damama.ru api.ttport.net и т. п. Обычно в такой сертификат входит 5 доменов и их количество можно увеличивать с шагом в 5.\nСертификаты c поддержкой IDN\nЗдесь все очевидно. Поддержка кириллицы, доменов вида моясобака.com и иже с ними Не у всех центров сертификации указана эта опция в описании сертификата, и, соответстенно, не все сертификаты поддерживаются работу с IDN доменами. Список сертификатов, у которых есть такая поддержка:\nThawte SSL123 Certificate Thawte SSL Web Server Symantec Secure Site Thawte SGC SuperCerts Thawte SSL Web Server Wildcard Thawte SSL Web Server with EV Symantec Secure Site Pro Symantec Secure Site with EV Symantec Secure Site Pro with EV Чем еще отличаются сертификаты между собой # Скоростью выпуска. Быстрее всего выпускаются сертификаты с валидацией только домена, дольше всего с EV валидацией, от 7 рабочих дней. Количество перевыпусков сертификата — у большинства центров сертификации неограниченно. Требуется, если допустили ошибку в данных об организации. При этом перевыпуском, по сути, является заказ нового сертификата. Причем не всегда с возвратом средств.\nГарантия — для некоторых сертификатов есть гарантия от 10.000 $. Это гарантия скорее не для покупателя сертификата, а для посетителя сайта, где установлен сертификат. В случае если посетитель сайта с таким сертификатом пострадает от фрауда и потеряет деньги, то центр сертификации обязуется их ему компенсировать до суммы указанной в гарантии. То есть центр сертификации как бы дает гарантию на свои сертификаты и что их невозможно установить на «левый» домен. На практике такие случае мне не известны поэтому на этот параметр можно не обращать внимание.\nБесплатный тестовый период — из платных сертификатов есть у symantec secure site, geotrust rapidssl, comodo positive ssl, thawte ssl web server. Также можете для тестов использовать бесплатные сертификаты: StartSSL™ Free\nВозврат средств — есть почти у всех сертификатов в течении 30 дней, хотя бывают и сертификаты без периода moneyback\nНемного о CA # Как уже говорилось ранее, от \u0026ldquo;популярности\u0026rdquo; CA зависит то, насколько большой контингент пользователей, а точнее браузеров, будут принимат Ваш сертификат как доверенный\nЦентров сертификации существует достаточно много, вот перечень самых популярных:\nComodo — работает с 1998 штабквартира в Jersey City, New Jersey, США. Geotrust — основан в 2001, в 2006 продан Verisign, штабквартира Mountain View, California, США Symantec — бывший Verisign в состав которого входит и Geotrust. Купил всех в 2010 году. Thawte — основан в 1995, продан Verisign в 1999. Trustwave — работает с 1995, штабквартира Chicago, Illinois, США. Кроме того. в последние годы набирает популярность тенденция за защищенный веб. Все больше центров сертификации предоставляет бесплатные сертификаты.\nИз ограничений бесплатных сертификатов, обычно:\nСрок действия (от 3-6 мес. Однако ряд CA предоставляет такие сертификаты сроком до 3 лет) Количество сертификатов выдаваемых на один домен/одно лицо. Получение SSL сертификата # Первый, простой и бесплатный способ это генерация самоподписного сертификата собственными силами.\nСамоподписной сертификат # Выпуск сертификата. # Выпуск сертификата на сервере зависит от самого сервера. Если используется панель управления, то зачастую сгенерировать сертификат можно с ее помощью. Если же ее нет, или в ней не поддерживается возможность выпуска сертификата, то это можно сделать следующим образом.\nЗаходим на сервер и выпоняем запрс, который сгенерирует сертификат, и закрытый ключ:\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -nodes -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 500 Секретный ключ впри данных опциях будет расположен в текущей директории, а сам сертификат будет выведен на экран.\nreg - запрос на создание сертификата; -new - создание запроса на сертификат; -newkey rsa:1024 - создание нового ключа длинной 1024 бит. Длина ключа может быть любой. Однако здесь необходимо соблюдать баланс между защищенностью и скоростью работы. Чем длиннее ключ - тем дольше будет происходить шифрация и дешифрация при отправлении сообщений между клиентом и сервером -nodes - не шифровать закрытый ключ; -keyout ca.key - сохранить закрытый ключ в файл и именем ca.key. Можно указать название по своему усмотрению, однако для простоты дальнейшей работы рекомендуется указывать что это именно ключ (.key) для определенного сертификата (ca, cert, certificate); -x509 - создание именно самоподписного сертификата; -days 500 - срок действия сертификата. Вместо 500 можно указать иное значение или же вовсе опустить этот ключ. В таком случае сертификат будет бессрочны; Так же можно указать следующие опции\n-out /путь/до/сертификата/ca.pem -keyout /путь/до/ключа/ca.key Генерация представляет собой диалог, где у пользователя выясняются следующие данные:\nCountry Name (2 letter code) [AU]:\t*В поле Country должен двубуквенный код страны по стандарту ISO 3166-1* State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: Locality Name (eg, city) []: Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty L]: Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: Email Address []: чтобы избежать диалога, в запросе на сертификат можно сразу указать все необходимые данные. В таком случае запрос примет например такой вид:\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -nodes -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 500 -subj /C=RU/ST=Moscow/L=Moscow/O=Companyname/OU=User/CN=etc/emailAddress=support@site.com -out ca.crt -subj \u0026lt;...\u0026gt; - данные сертификата вида параметр=значение, которые перечисляются через слеш \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;\nПосле успешной генерации можно переходить к установке сертификата.\nСертификаты от CA # Другие сертификаты необходимо получать у центров сертификации. Основные моменты здесь стиледующие:\nВыбор сертификата. Выбор центра сертификации. Кроме того, желательно что бы путь от корневого сертификата до подписчика (собственно самого сертификата) был как можно короче. Чем длиннее - тем может быть медленнее соединение и ожиание запроса. При проверке сертификата корневой сертификат обычно идет проверяться в страну, где расположен CA.\nВыбор CA повлияет на следующе параметры:\nДоверие. Будет ли установлен сертификат CA в большинстве браузеров или нет; Стоимость сертификата; Гарантия. Этот пунт скорее для посетителей, так как CA дает гарантии того, что данный сертификат установлен только на тот/те домены, на который/которые он выдан; Тип шифрования md5(уже не используется)/sha1(самый популярный)/sha256(то, что будет использоваться завтра); Какие данные потребуются CA от заказчика для выпуска сертификата; Скорость выпуска; Число перевыпусков сертификата; Наличие или отсутствие тестового периода; Возможность возврата средств и сроки отмены заказанного сертификата. Запрос на получение и получение самого сертификата # Для получения сертификата необходимо сформировать специальный запрс - Certificate Signing Request. В ходе формирования запроса буду заданы несколько вопросов о домене, компании, личности самого получателя, почты, на которую будет выслано поддтверждение на выпуск и сам сертификат.\nСгенерировать запрос можно как самостоятельно, так и через центр сертификации.\nПосле завершения генерации будет создано два ключа - публичный и приватный. Публичный ключ не является секретным и помещается в запрос на выпуск сертификата. Сам запрос выглядит примерно следующим образом:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- BDBhfbHDDJEOcnjvbubBDHBCCcjbBHBjBhHjkGbhbcueHBDBgddwhBHBDHBedbkc \u0026lt;...\u0026gt; HBhb8gy+HnceufHBHb+J+tYGhy== -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- Данные запроса, ключа, сертификата можно расшифровать и проверить с помощью специальных декодеров.\nРасшифровать запрос можно следующей командой:\nopenssl req -noout -text -in cert.csr Для проверки данных сертификата можно выполнить:\nopenssl x509 -noout -text -in cert.crt Для проверки соответствия ключа и сертификата необходимо сразнить значения вывода команд (должны совпадать):\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in cert.crt | openssl md5 openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in cert.key | openssl md5 Несколько других полезных команд: # Создание для SSL-сертификата только ключа:\nopenssl req -batch -noout -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert.key Генерация CSR-запроса:\nopenssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csr Убрать пароль с ключа:\nopenssl rsa -in cert.key -out cert.key Проверка выдачи https (после установки сертификата):\nopenssl s_client -host ulanovka.ru -port 443 Как измерить производительность сетевого соединения:\nopenssl s_time -connect remote.host:443 Установка сертификата на сервер # После самостоятельной генерации сертификата, либо получения его у CA необходимо установить сертификат на сервер и проверить его работу. Для корректной установки зачастую требуется корневой сертификат CA. Свободно скачать его можно на сайте Центра сертификации.\nНекоторые панели управления хостингом дают возможность не только сгенерировать, но и установить, а так же настроить переадресацию на защищенное соединение.\nВ иных случаях действия по установке необходимо производить из консоли.\nДля начала необходимо определить какой сервис \u0026ldquo;слушает\u0026rdquo; 80 порт (данный порт по умолчанию используется протоколом http). Cделать это можно выполнив команду:\nnetstat -ntpl | grep :80 Вывод может быть например следующим:\ntcp 0 0 188.120.233.16:80 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 731/apache2 На выводе видно, что Apche2 отвечает на http запросы по IP 188.120.233.16. Значит и сертификат необходимо устанавливать на него. В случае если вместо apache2 указан nginx либо другой сервис, то и сертификат, соответственно, устанавливать на него.\nУстановка сертификата на BitrixVM # После получения сертификата у Вас на руках должны быть три файла:\nФайл ключа, полученый при генерации запрса на сертификат. Private key. Сертификат. Корневой или промежуточный сертификат. Предоставляется компанией, выпускающей Ваш сертификат. Файл скачевается с сайта компании-издателя. Обращаем Ваше внимание, что для разных операционных системы эти файлы различны. Файлы необходимо скопировать на Вашу виртуальную машину из под пользователя root в каталог /etc/nginx/ssl/\nПереходим в каталог:\ncd /etc/nginx/ssl Затем объединяем файлы сертификата для домена и промежуточного(корневого) сертификата в одим файл с расширением .pem следующей командой:\ncat domen.crt root.crt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; cert_domen.pem где vash_domen.crt - сертификат выпущенный для Вашего домена, root.crt - корневой сертификат Вашего центра сертификации, cert_domen.pem - конечный файл.\nТеперь необходимо прописать в конфигурационном файле nginx /etc/nginx/bx/conf/ssl.conf путь до ключа и созданного .pem файла\nssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert_domen.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/private.key; где cert.pem - созданный .pem файл, private.key - файл ключа.\nТак же необходимо проверить следующие строки:\nserver { listen 193.107.238.159:443 default_server ssl; ssl on; #Включает протокол https для данного сервера ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert_domen.pem; #Путь до созданного из сертификата для домена и корневого сертификата файл ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key; # ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; proxy_read_timeout 200s; access_log off; include static.conf; location / { root /var/www/web/sites; try_files /$host/ @default_host; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:80; proxy_redirect http://127.0.0.1:80/ /; } } Осталось только перезагрузить nginx:\nservice nginx restart Установка на сервер с Apache2 # Для установки сертификата на веб сервис Apache2, в общем случае, нужно скопировать уже существующий виртуальный хост для http-соединения, сменить порт с 80 на 443, добавить ряд строк:\n\u0026lt;VirtualHost IPv4 или IPv6 адрес, либо *:443\u0026gt; DocumentRoot /var/www/leader_site ServerName www.leader_site.com SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/bazov_cert.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/private.key SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/crt/promejut_cert.crt \u0026lt;...\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/VirtualHost\u0026gt; Где:\nSSLCertificateFile – файл основного сертификата для вашего домена. SSLCertificateKeyFile – файл с ключом, сгенерированный в процессе создания CSR. SSLCertificateChainFile – файл промежуточного сертификата (если он имеется), предоставленный вашим центром сертификации. Если эта директива не работает, попробуйте вместо нее использовать SSLCACertificateFile. Дальше, сохраняем изменения, тестируем конфигурацию Apache:\napachectl configtest В случае успеха перезапускаем сервис Apache:\napachectl restart Или пары команд:\napachectl stop apachectl start Установка на сервер с Nginx # Проверяем наличие всех трех файлов: ключа, самого сертифката, корневого сертификата. Копируем ключ, и создаем сертификат который будет скормлен nginx:\ncp mail.example.com.key /etc/pki/nginx/private/ cat mail.example.com.crt sub.class1.server.ca.pem \u0026gt; /etc/pki/nginx/certs/mail.example.com.pem2 В конфигурации для хоста nginx необходимо проверить наличие записей вида:\nserver { listen 443; server_name mail.example.com; ssl on; ssl_certificate /etc/pki/nginx/certs/mail.example.com.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/pki/nginx/private/mail.example.com.key; ssl_session_timeout 5m; ssl_protocols SSLv2 SSLv3 TLSv1; ssl_ciphers ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; location / { root /srv/www/htdocs/; index index.html index.htm; } } Здесь, ssl_session_timeout - время жизни сессии. При увеличении времени жизни сессии, нужно быть готовым к тому, что в error логах могут появиться записи вида:\n2014/03/18 13:36:08 [crit] 18730#0: ngx_slab_alloc() failed: no memory in SSL session shared cache \u0026#34;SSL\u0026#34;. ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; - говорит о том, что при использовании различных протоколов, серверные шифры были более приоритетны, чем клиентские.\nssl_stapling on; - gозволяет серверу прикреплять OCSP-ответы, тем самым уменьшая время загрузки страниц у пользователей. ЗДесь имеются ввиду ответы о валидности сертификата (при проверке на отозванность). С точки зрения безопасности пользователя не важно, кто передает ответы — веб-сервер или сервер CA — ведь ответ в любом случае подписан и валидность ответа тоже можно проверить, а ответ включает в себя свой срок действия. Для работы этой функции нужно указать DNS-сервер, что и делается директивой resolver.\nВ Nginx поддержка статических ключей для session tickets добавлена в версиях 1.5.8+. Настройка tls session tickets при работе с несколькими серверами делается следующим образом:\nssl_session_ticket_key current.key; ssl_session_ticket_key prev.key; ssl_session_ticket_key prevprev.key; В данном случае current.key — ключ, который используется в настоящий момент времени. Prev.key — ключ, используемый N часов до начала использования current.key. Prevprev.key — ключ, используемый N часов до начала использования prev.key. Значение N должно быть равно указанному в ssl_session_timeout. Мы рекомендуем исходить из интервала в 28 часов.\nВажным моментом является способ ротации ключей, т.к. атакующий, укравший ключ для шифрования тикетов, может расшифровать все сессии (в том числе PFS) в пределах жизни ключа.\nДалее, так же проверяется корректность командой:\nnginx -t И перезагружается вебсервер командой\nnginx -s reload Осуществляется проверка - готово!\nНебольшое отступление о протоколах и шифрах и прочих аспектах безопасности # Шифры # Для подписи сертификата используются криптографические алгоритмы с открытым ключом, чаще всего это RSA, DSA или ECDSA.\nНаиболее распространены, в частности из-за массовой поддержки версиями протоколов и ОС, сертификаты с использованием RSA. Его недостаток - размер ключа и зависящая от его длины производительность.\nDSA, при прочих равных, быстрее RSA, при этом ECDSA гораздо быстрее классической DSA. Однако, увы но некоторые версии ОС и браузеров данный алгоритм шифрования не поддерживают.\nСтойкость наиболее распространенных алгоритмов ЭЦП напрямую зависит от стойкости (безопасности) используемой хэш функции. Основные используемые алгоритмы хеширования:\nMD5 — сегодня считается небезопасным и не используется; SHA-1 — использовался для подписывания большинства сертификатов до 2014 года, сейчас признан небезопасным; SHA-256 — алгоритм, который уже сегодня пришел на замену SHA-1; SHA-512 — на сегодняшний день используется довольно редко. Протоколы # Ряд протоколов, например SSLv2 и SSLv3 содержат фундаментальные уязвимости. Поэтому, их крайне желательно отключать. Кроме того, сейчас почти все клиенты сейчас имеют поддержку TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 TLS и 1.2.\nВ случае, если необходима поддержка клиентов с SSLv3, то в качестве компенсационной меры можно разрешить использовать его только с алгоритмом RC4. Правильная конфигурация для Nginx в части протоколов будет выглядеть так:\nssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; Что касается выбора ciphersuites или наборов шифров и хеш-функций, которые будут использоваться для TLS-соединений, — веб-серверы должны использовать только безопасные шифры. Здесь важно соблюсти баланс между безопасностью, скоростью, производительностью и совместимостью. Например, рекомендуемые компанией Яндекс значения:\nssl_ciphers kEECDH+AES128:kEECDH:kEDH:-3DES:kRSA+AES128:kEDH+3DES:DES-CBC3-SHA:!RC4:!aNULL:!eNULL:!MD5:!EXPORT:!LOW:!SEED:!CAMELLIA:!IDEA:!PSK:!SRP:!SSLv2; Заставляем строго соблюдать эти директивы:\nssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; Заголовки # Подключаемые для пущей безопасности веб-серфига заголовки, будем рассматривать на примере Nginx.\nВ целом, все они, по большей части, направлены на пресечение xss атак.\nСледующий заголовок указывает браузерам сколько они должны помнить данные требования безопасности для моего домена.\nadd_header Strict-Transport-Security «max-age=31536000;»; Если же дополнить строку до:\nadd_header Strict-Transport-Security «max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload»; то данные условия будут применимы ко всем доменам третьего и выше уровня вашего домена.\nСледующий заголовок определяет HTTP-заголовки Content-Security-Policy и Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only, которые сообщают браузеру список хостов, с которых он может загружать различные ресурсы:\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only «default-src https:; script-src https: \u0026#39;unsafe-eval\u0026#39; \u0026#39;unsafe-inline\u0026#39;; style-src https: \u0026#39;unsafe-inline\u0026#39;; img-src https: data:; font-src https: data:; report-uri /csp-report»; Установка почтового сертификата # Postfix # У нас уже имеются все 3, не раз упоминаемых ранее файлов.

Вновь копируем ключ, создаем сертификат который скушает dovecot:\ncp mail.example.com.key /etc/pki/dovecot/private/ cat mail.example.com.crt sub.class1.server.ca.pem \u0026gt; /etc/pki/dovecot/certs/mail.example.com.pem В dovecot.conf прописываем:\nssl_cert_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/certs/mail.example.com.pem ssl_key_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/private/mail.example.com.key Включаем SSL:\nssl_listen = * ssl = yes Добавить в список протоколов необходимые:\nprotocols = pop3 pop3s imap imaps Важно! Если необходимо обеспечить IMAP и POP на разных субдоменах например imap.example.com и pop.example.com, то нужно для каждого субдомена подготовить сертификаты и внести следующие изменения в dovecot.conf:\nprotocol imap { listen = 192.0.2.1:143 ssl_listen = 192.0.2.1:993 ssl_cert_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/certs/imap.example.com.pem ssl_key_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/private/imap.example.com.key } protocol pop3 { listen = 192.0.2.1:110 ssl_listen = 192.0.2.1:995 ssl_cert_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/certs/pop.example.com.pem ssl_key_file = /etc/pki/dovecot/private/pop.example.com.key } Перезапускаем сервис и проверяем:\n/etc/init.d/dovecot reload Замена сертификата # Так как каждый сертификат имеет срок действия, то после его окончания необходимо вновь отправить запрс на получение сертификата и заменить файлы старого сертификата новыми.\nUPD.

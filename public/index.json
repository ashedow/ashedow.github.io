Between the end of 2010 and 2011, the band started creating various music puzzles, anti-music, and even lengthier pieces of music. Examples include MP3 files that are actually RAR archives, password-encrypted files, pieces embedded within other formats, such as pdf, jpg, txt, exe and jpg, pieces listed with negative song lengths, and a variety of SWF files.\nAlso they publish \u0026ldquo;Unperformable music – an ontological approach\u0026rdquo; Improbable.com. May 9, 2016. Retrieved May 14, 2016.\nMedical Unperformability: # “Given biological limitations, no actual organism can generate a genuine performance.” e.g. Ligeti’s Étude No. 14A: Coloana fara sfârşit (Column without End) More example:\nU.N. Owen Was Her? U.N. Owen Was Her? or U.N. Ooen wa kanojo na no ka?) - is a theme song composed by ZUN for the sixth Touhou Project game Embodiment of Scarlet Devil that\u0026rsquo;s associated to Flandre Scarlet. His comments on the song imply that it was his favourite during the time of the game. \u0026ldquo;Faerie\u0026rsquo;s Aire and Death Waltz\u0026rdquo; presented by CSMTA - This \u0026ldquo;musical piece\u0026rdquo; (and I use the term lightly) has been considered unplayable, but here is a full-fledged attempt. Resplendent with directions such as \u0026ldquo;Release the Penguins\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sell Mute\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Watch for Slippage\u0026rdquo;, the Aurora division of the Colorado State Music Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Assoc. brings this almost-impossible performance to the stage, to the delight and chagrin of the 2009 State Music Conference attendees.\nFinally was played by several people: Synthesia - Night of Nights - another \u0026ldquo;musical piece\u0026rdquo;, which can\u0026rsquo;t be played by 1-2 people the quick brown fox speedkore 4 kidz - a track with a higher than 300 bpm tempo that cannot be played by a human, but the computer has changed the rules of the game Read more How to Perform Impossible Rhythms or local\nSo here we are with technical unperformability\nBlack MIDI is a music genre consisting of compositions that use MIDI files to create a song or a remix containing a large number of notes. So in terms of unperformabel music - these days we can write, but we can\u0026rsquo;t play some of the black midi tracks.\nNomic Unperformability: # “Given the actual laws of nature, there can be no genuine performances.” e.g. Bull of Heaven’s 2014 work 310: ΩΣPx0(2^18×5^18)p*k*k*k, (with a running time of 3.343 quindecillion years. So we can hear a small pice, but not the whole work) Another example is \u0026ldquo;Traveler\u0026rdquo; by Dr Wesley Cray. It is an illustration of the idea of unworkable works. It has a score with sheet music in it. And a note on it says that the musician has to play 10 years back in time. back in time. Such a piece, in theory, could be performed in another universe.\nLogical Unperformability: # “Given logical constraints, there can be no genuine performances.” e.g. Tribute to I.F. Kilmister: (three musicians each, individually and simultaneously, play a single note [on electric guitar, electric bass, and drum kit, respectively] louder than the other two play their notes.)\nDr Wesley Cray wrote a score that said the musician must play the note \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; while refraining from playing any note.\nThe professor’s paper also alerts us to ‘Unperformable Works for Performance’ and ‘Trivial Unperformabilities’, going on to argue that :\n“- the very possibility of such works is ontologically significant. In particular, the possibility of these works raises serious problems for type-theoretic accounts of the ontology of music as well as certain mereological or constitution-based accounts.” see: \u0026ldquo;Unperformable Works and the Ontology of Music\u0026rdquo; (2016, British Journal of Aesthetics, 56(1): 67-81). A full copy may be found here. local\nIn March 2011, the band released a series of pieces of extraordinary length. This series, ranging from their numerical ordering of 238–260, is similar to the Longplayer idea – each sound is the length of a prime number, and each subsequent piece creates near-infinite lengths of time before they\u0026rsquo;re synchronized. The final in the series, 260: lcm(2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83) would last 8,462,937,602,125,701,219,674,955.2362595095 years before all the pieces synchronized.\nBut for what? # Avant-garde artists break the rules in music, their works are recognised as music, and now the whole world perceives music a bit more widely. If nobody ever broke the once-established boundaries, music would stop changing. Writing unplayable music is also a trespass and the existence of such works is part and parcel of the development of music as an art.\nSome more useful links # \u0026ldquo;Genuine works of music\u0026rdquo; part of lecture Unperformable Works and the Ontology of Art ","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/music/demoscene_and_unperformable_music/","section":"Posts","summary":"Demoscene accepted as UNESCO cultural heritage in The Netherlands and topic about unperformable music # The Dutch inscription is continuing the success story of the demoscene as first digital culture accepted by the UNESCO.","title":"Demoscene as UNESCO cultural heritage and unperformable music"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Micro blog","summary":"","title":"Micro blog"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#art"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#guide/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#guide"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#link/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#link"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#math/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#math"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/#panic_attack/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"#panic_attack"},{"content":"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh Mathematical artist in Qom, Iran.

How to\nGuide по ПА (нас попросили - мы написали)\nПаническая атака как единичное явление обычно бывает следствием проникновения в сознание некоторой пугающей и/или болезненной информации.\nОсновной мотив ПА - это страх и неизбежность/фатальность/предопределённость.\nОсновной симптом - учащение сердцебиения и дыхания и туннельное восприятие как следствие активации симпатической нервной системы.\nИными словами: организм воспринимает некоторую мысль как угрожающую жизни. Что, конечно же, неправда. От одной только мысли ещё никто не умирал.\nПричины таких реакций при желании можно найти и проанализировать самостоятельно или с терапевтом.\nСправиться с ПА в острой фазе можно двумя путями:\nФизиологический: глубоко и медленно дышать под счёт. Когнитивный: сказать себе: «Окей, у меня ПА. Это нормально, так бывает. Меня что-то напугало, я с этим разберусь, но объективно моей жизни и здоровью прямо сейчас ничего не угрожает». Ну да, выпить тоже скорее всего поможет, но это скользкая дорожка. Как помочь товарищу при ПА:\nНе паниковать самому. Спокойно ровно говорить что-то в духе: «Похоже у тебя ПА и тебя что-то испугало. Ты главное дыши: «Вдох-выдох». Я тут, я рядом, ты справишься, это пройдёт, все наладится, у меня тоже так было» и что-то ещё ровное умиротворяющее. Если знаете, что триггернуло и можете предложить решение - предложите. Если товарищ не реагирует на речь, задыхается и выглядит совсем плохо - спокойно ровно сказать, что ты хочешь помочь, поэтому сейчас вызываешь скорую. Скорее всего это приведёт к диалогу. Очень важно вести себя уверенно и доброжелательно, чтобы не испугать товарища ещё сильнее. Отвлечь/отвлечься на что угодно другое может помочь купировать ПА в моменте, но повышает риск рецидива, тк триггерящая информация в этом случае не будет усвоена сознанием, и с определённой вероятностью вызовет аналогичную реакцию в похожей ситуации в будущем. Оптимальный вариант, если физиология позволяет держать ручку/телефон - записывать все возникающие мысли - это очень помогает успокоиться, а также позволит проанализировать триггеры и лучше понять себя.\n","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/ru_posts/panic_attack/","section":"Posts","summary":"Panic attack.

Parallels between Biology and other sciences\nWill we ever understand biology like we currently understand physics*? My take is no (and it seems clear) but curious to hear other takes!\nThe study of organisms looks no less complex than the study of distant space systems.\nAnd while the study of a collection of organ systems looks like a rather pessimistic undertaking, the study of a single system looks somewhat more rosy. At least the paper Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor? seems more optimistic than the paper Can a biologist fix a radio?—Or, what I learned while studying apoptosis\nOn the other hand, watching the AI in Drug Discovery but not being involved in the industry I cannot be super optimistic in this direction. We have many tools and experiments, research, papers, pre-prints \u0026hellip; but databases are not open\nI just like this lecture about stats https://youtu.be/hVimVzgtD6w?t=921. trash in-trash out. \u0026ldquo;we cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to start to analyse it. At most what is available is rare data from platforms like Kaggle, sometimes some other open data or a piece of data from services like drugbank.\nIt is true that this is understandable for security reasons. But I would like to see something similar to \u0026ldquo;Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor\u0026rdquo; but on drug design or gerontology.\n“No one ever realized it until now, but here’s a strong contender for the root cause of Disease X”. And that could lead to predictions like “So that means that inhibiting this particular kinase that no one has cared about until now should be a drug for the disease”, or (more likely) \u0026#34;If you can find some way to interfere with this pathway over here, that would attack Disease X at a key point\u0026#34;. That would be a very nice thing for software to tell us and\nSo at the moment, if you took any of the AI-generated molecules from these projects and showed them to an experienced medicinal chemist, the response would be \u0026#34;Well, yeah, sure\u0026#34;, and probably also \u0026#34;You\u0026#39;d better check to make sure those are actually patentable\u0026#34;. Did this computational approach speed things up, though? Wills\u0026#39; blog post mentions the number of compounds that the company says were actually synthesized in each of these three cases (350, 163, and 500, respectively). These are not at all out of line with what you would expect from doing a traditional fast-follower effort off of known chemical matter. It would be interesting to know if these were all synthesized from a first run of recommendations of the AI software, or if assay results were fed back in as the compounds appeared and were tested, but either way that seems to be a reasonable amount of SAR, given the fact that you\u0026#39;re starting in well-studied chemical space. The time savings would come, though, if the software was able to direct synthesis in a way that you were sure that whatever you went to the trouble of making would also be in those areas of legally clear space. So as far as I can tell, that\u0026#39;s where we are now. But again, credit where it\u0026#39;s due: these are early days, and it\u0026#39;s going to be the easier problems that yield first. Right now, the AI stuff is working at the level of \u0026#34;Hey, here\u0026#39;s a whole bunch of people working on Target X for Disease Y - is there any room for me in there?\u0026#34;. That of course doesn\u0026#39;t get at the reasons why we still have nearly a 90% failure rate overall in the clinic in this business, which are that it turns generally out that Target X really isn\u0026#39;t that useful against Disease Y, or that our compounds directed towards it do other things that we didn\u0026#39;t expect. Those are the harder problems``` [Notes on end-to-end biology](https://nintil.com/biology-llms) ","date":"23 June 2023","permalink":"/posts/understanding_biology/","section":"Posts","summary":"Understanding biology.

A lot of people looked at France, and what went on there after the french revolution in 1789. In 1793 the French invaded The Netherlands, and the Netherlands became a vassal state of the French empire. This also meant that our laws changed to French laws, or the ‘code Napoléon’.\nIn 1811 Civil Registration was introduced in the entire Netherlands. A public record where all births, deaths and marriages were recorded. (The southern part of the Netherlands has had this since 1796). This also meant that a family name had to be registered. Most of the time, people were addressed with their first name, followed by the first name of (mostly) their father, followed by the suffix -son or -daughter.\nThis would however pose a problem with the new Civil Registry. For example, the father\u0026rsquo;s surname may be different from the son\u0026rsquo;s surname. For example, Jan\u0026rsquo;s father\u0026rsquo;s name is Karel. Thus his name would be Jana Karelsun. Jan has a son called Pete. His full name would be Pete Jansun. Thus, there were no surnames in the strict sense of the word.\nNote that this way of naming people is/was quite common throughout Europe, and is still used in some countries, Iceland being an example.\nIn 1811 ppl from the Netherlands were required by law to register themselves in the Civil Registry. Every family would have the same family name. Sometimes people would choose the name the father familias was already known for, which is why the family names ‘Jansen’ (from Janszoon) and ‘Pietersen’ (from Peterszoon) are so common.\nOften, people would choose their profession as a family name. ‘Bakker’ if they were a baker, ‘Visser’ (fisherman) or ‘de Ruyter’ (for a cavalerist).\nSometimes people would choose a funny name, maybe because they wanted to protest these new, pedantic rules from the French a little… so you would get family names like ‘Potjebier’ (glass of beer), ‘Zondergeld’ (without money) and ‘Goedemoed’ (in good spirits) or ‘de Man’, which translates literally into ‘the man’.\nSome more example: Naaktgeboren (“born naked”) - Weren\u0026rsquo;t we all? Van Lul (“from the dick”) - yep, we’re all from there. Van Kut (“from the pussy”) - I’d like to introduce you to my friend above… In t’ veld (“in the field”) - well, I suppose we know where your ancestors were when last names were given Niemantsverdriet (“never caused harm”) - I’d like to be that guy’s neighbor! Pijpers (“suckers”, the verb, not adjective :) - I realize that wasn’t the meaning back then… but it kinda is now Doodeman (“dead man”) - I am Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die! Geldmaker (“money maker”) - Dad, is that you? Sta van Uiter (“standing outside”) - will someone please let the guy in!? Hoeren (“hookers”) - Would you mind introducing me to your sisters? Eijkelhardt (“hard prick”) - are you the husband of Ms. Hookers? De Jode (“the Jew”) - I actually know a Catholic priest with that last name. I kid you not! Then again, Jesus was a Jew too! De Koe (“the cow”) - Are you sure you want another piece of that stroopwafel? Zuinig (“cheap / frugal”) - I guess I’ll be paying for dinner then… Zweep (“whip”) - Hey baby, I’ve been a naughty boy.\n","date":"20 June 2023","permalink":"/posts/what_is_code_napoleon/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is Code Napoléon or why Dutch surnames are so strange\nIn the late 1700s The Netherlands were pretty politically unstable.

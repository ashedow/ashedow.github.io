Hello world! I'm Iana (ashedow) and I'm interested in everything. 
Шэь interested in a huge number of things, from culture and anthropology, in all its forms, to airplanes and medicine.

Right now, I am most excited about developing in the area of big data analysis and visualization.

This site is kinda result of compilation and reworking of a huge amount of my notes, links, sheets and so on.

Gallery - mostly about travel photos

Euro

Apart from the story of the euro country and the eurozone and the euro area, the widespread move to online payment and the minimisation of the cache, there are some interesting facts about the euro notes

Banknotes

Each euro note has some sort of architectural type on it
it goes from the oldest to the newest most modern architecture:
* €5: Classical
* €10: Romanesque
* €20: Gothic
* €50: Renaissance
* €100: Baroque and rococo
* €200: 19th century iron & glass architecture

on the front of the bill, it's always the architecture type
on the back, it's always a bridge

These designs were created by Robert Kalina (https://www.worldcat.org/title/933267804) an Austrian designer. And they're all made up none of the bridges none of the places actually exist which is not true anymore.
A Designer called Robin Stum designed all the bridges across one of the Rotterdam channels to look like the bridges from the euro bills (https://hotspotholland.nl/spijkenisse-eurobrug)

Coins

The euro coins have a common side and a national side. The national sides indicate the issuing country, whereas the common sides show images of the European Union or of Europe and symbolise the unity of the EU. The 5, 2 and 1-cent coins show Europe in relation to Africa and Asia.

Euro symbol

The euro symbol – € – was inspired by the Greek letter epsilon (Є), a reference to the cradle of European civilisation. It also stands for the first letter of the word ‘Europe’ in the Latin alphabet, while the two parallel lines running through the symbol signify stability.

Check out the previous version of the eurobills had designed euro in latin and also in greek but the new version also has it in cyrillic euro why is it so well because in 2007 Bulgaria joined the EU and they put the sign euro on the bills in Cyrillic even though Bulgaria is not yet in the euro area.

## St Patrick's Day food pairing

Deep fried pickles are a popular snack food that originated in the Southern United States, particularly in the state of Texas. They are typically made by coating dill pickle slices in a batter made from flour, cornmeal, and various spices, and then deep-frying them until they are golden brown and crispy.
Deep fried pickles are a popular food pairing with green beer on St. Patrick's Day. It is unclear why this specific food pairing became popular, but theories suggest that deep fried pickles originated in the Southern United States and the Midwest, where they became popular at fairs and restaurants. The salty and tangy flavor of pickles pairs well with beer, and the crispiness of the deep fried pickles balances the sweetness of other St. Patrick's Day treats.

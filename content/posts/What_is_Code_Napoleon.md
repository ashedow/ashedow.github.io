What is Code Napoléon or why Dutch surnames are so strange 

![](/images/rpzrmkoi7ev6.png)

In the late 1700s The Netherlands were pretty politically unstable. A lot of people looked at France, and what went on there after the french revolution in 1789. In 1793 the French invaded The Netherlands, and the Netherlands became a vassal state of the French empire. This also meant that our laws changed to French laws, or the ‘code Napoléon’.

In 1811 Civil Registration was introduced in the entire Netherlands. A public record where all births, deaths and marriages were recorded. (The southern part of the Netherlands has had this since 1796). This also meant that a family name had to be registered. Most of the time, people were addressed with their first name, followed by the first name of (mostly) their father, followed by the suffix -son or -daughter. 

This would however pose a problem with the new Civil Registry. 
For example, the father's surname may be different from the son's surname. For example, Jan's father's name is Karel. Thus his name would be Jana Karelsun. Jan has a son called Pete. His full name would be Pete Jansun. Thus, there were no surnames in the strict sense of the word. 

Note that this way of naming people is/was quite common throughout Europe, and is still used in some countries, Iceland being an example.

In 1811 ppl from the Netherlands were required by law to register themselves in the Civil Registry. Every family would have the same family name. Sometimes people would choose the name the father familias was already known for, which is why the family names ‘Jansen’ (from Janszoon) and ‘Pietersen’ (from Peterszoon) are so common.

Often, people would choose their profession as a family name. ‘Bakker’ if they were a baker, ‘Visser’ (fisherman) or ‘de Ruyter’ (for a cavalerist).

Sometimes people would choose a funny name, maybe because they wanted to protest these new, pedantic rules from the French a little… so you would get family names like ‘Potjebier’ (glass of beer), ‘Zondergeld’ (without money) and ‘Goedemoed’ (in good spirits) or  ‘de Man’, which translates literally into ‘the man’.

Some more example:
* Naaktgeboren (“born naked”) - Weren't we all?
* Van Lul (“from the dick”) - yep, we’re all from there.
* Van Kut (“from the pussy”) - I’d like to introduce you to my friend above…
* In t’ veld (“in the field”) - well, I suppose we know where your ancestors were when last names were given
* Niemantsverdriet (“never caused harm”) - I’d like to be that guy’s neighbor!
* Pijpers (“suckers”, the verb, not adjective :) - I realize that wasn’t the meaning back then… but it kinda is now
* Doodeman (“dead man”) - I am Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die!
* Geldmaker (“money maker”) - Dad, is that you?
* Sta van Uiter (“standing outside”) - will someone please let the guy in!?
* Hoeren (“hookers”) - Would you mind introducing me to your sisters?
* Eijkelhardt (“hard prick”) - are you the husband of Ms. Hookers?
* De Jode (“the Jew”) - I actually know a Catholic priest with that last name. I kid you not! Then again, Jesus was a Jew too!
* De Koe (“the cow”) - Are you sure you want another piece of that stroopwafel?
* Zuinig (“cheap / frugal”) - I guess I’ll be paying for dinner then…
* Zweep (“whip”) - Hey baby, I’ve been a naughty boy.

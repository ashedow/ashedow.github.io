# How to read TAF

> TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) is a weather forecast at an airport or military base for a specific period (usually 24 hours).
TAFs are an educated guess, METARs aren’t.

## Type of Reports

Depending on how quickly the weather changes, you will see three types of reports:

1. TAF
2. TAF AMD (amended). These will always supersede the previously issued TAF. You may not know the TAF is amended except by the issued time. Usually, TAFs are issued 20 to 40 minutes prior to the standard issue time. The standard issue times are 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z. So, a TAF issued at 0430Z instead of 0540Z is an indication it’s an amended TAF. 
4. TAF COR (corrected)

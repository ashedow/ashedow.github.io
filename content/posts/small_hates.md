This course explained to me how they line up and why managers need one-on-one metings.


BUT!


I'm getting nauseous from the communication course and realising how much it's all geared towards offline. 
You have to read body language, empathy, be a leader - weee

With a release date of late 2020-2022 (for the majority of the course). Online, remote, asynchronous communication, vr/ar/mr metaverse - have not heard.

EI tips on the courses not just about politeness. its just post-post meta-meta language over the true. Feels like scald poem lang learning

Okay. Okay.

Emotional intelligence is crucial. I fully admit it. It is really important to understand other people's point of view, to find a balance between empathy and responsibility, to demonstrate the ability to listen and respond appropriately to various verbal and non-verbal cues. 


But sometimes I think it's just learning the kind of poetry of the skalds and the alliterations and the "heiti"s and "kjenning"s
Let's say it's just a language of its own. But where's my full vocabulary of face-body language!?

Just talk with ppl! Ya?

It also sometimes looks like "we have explained some of the accepted rules of conduct in a given environment. And with this course, we are going to grow people who will support that culture."
I fully endorse some of the items. Like don't be a dick. Act the way you want others to act around you. 

But some of the things that are more like manipulation or hypnosis techniques (see the book "Have You Tried Hypnosis?") for manipulation purposes are really pissing me off. 

Soft yes, please. Do a favor to reach your goal. Empathy (say hi to all neurodivergents in this chat). Just be comfortable for everyone around and do not show you opinion in the most effective way.

F*ck


otherwise we'll be an illustration to [How to Build Toxic Software Teams](https://badsoftwareadvice.substack.com/p/how-to-build-toxic-software-teams):
People want to get along.

Most people, if they are shown some respect, will figure out a way to make peace with their coworkers. As the leader of a team wanting to create a toxic culture and have it still be going when you return from prison, you need to create a team that never reaches this peace.


* Foster a culture of inconsistent goals
    The definition of quality work should not be consistent and well-understood. Imagine that you are a working at a restaurant making soup, and a head chef decides if your soup is good enough everyday and you only get paid if it is. You make the soup the same everyday, but some days it isn't good enough. You start to imagine reasons - maybe the chef doesn't like you, maybe someone is messing with your ingredients, maybe you don’t know what you are doing, maybe you have angered the soup God - the stress of this situation given the stakes will create a paranoid and uncollaborative workforce.

    This is your goal - create a culture in which only your approval is a measure of good or bad. Make this approval infrequent and inconsistent. As soon as the soupmaker starts to feel empowered, spit out his soup. Occassionly say things like “this soup is OK, but Barbara doesn’t like it”. Extra points if there is no coworker named Barbara. This single action will kill any hopes of a team with ownership - after all, if it isn't good enough often enough they will never feel like it is their soup.


* Discourage creativity
    If something goes wrong, start an investigation. Figure out who to blame and do it publically. Raise your voice, send nasty emails, mean-mug without delay. Anytime there is a failure, don't miss an opportunity to assert your authority. Attach ideas to specific people, not to the team. The team may come up with an idea, but failure falls to one person.

    This will prevent the team from trying new things and keep making soup while hoping for the best. Eventually, they will also get better at investigations than making food.

* Go away, then return with chaos
    If you lead the team, don't show up. Don't tell anybody. In general be very hard to reach. Move or cancel meetings, then show up late to the ones you do attend. Don’t let meetings start without you, then change the subject ten minutes after you arrive. Make it so that people simply do not know what you are about to say, then surprise them.

* Prepare the team for their next leader
    If you do these steps, the next leader will be easy to find - he or she can only be found from outside the team. Nobody left on the team can be head chef, they only know how to fearfully make crappy soup and run internal investigations. Congratulations - you have properly prepared the team for their next leader.

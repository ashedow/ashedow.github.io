## I would say a few words about communication courses

Techniques to improve the quality and speed of communication. 
Following anti-fragility principles and being prepared for black swans. 
How to give and receive high-quality feedback. 
How to pitch your ideas strategically.
how to treat you, ensuring you maximize your professional performanceâ€”starting today.
How to communicate and what to pay special attention to when building effective communication With representatives of different cultures.
How to ask question and vlidate youself.
How to set up and achieva a goals.
How to deal with conflicts.
Planning, agendas, presentations, letters, presentations, practical ideas to become a team player, time management tips etc.

These are all great parts of the course. Even if in places it is overly drawn out

This course explained to me how they line up and why managers need one-on-one metings.


BUT!


I'm getting nauseous from the communication course and realising how much it's all geared towards offline. 
You have to read body language, empathy, be a leader - weee

With a release date of late 2020-2022 (for the majority of the course). Online, remote, asynchronous communication, vr/ar/mr metaverse - have not heard.

EI tips on the courses not just about politeness. its just post-post meta-meta language over the true. Feels like scald poem lang learning

Okay. Okay.

Emotional intelligence is crucial. I fully admit it. It is really important to understand other people's point of view, to find a balance between empathy and responsibility, to demonstrate the ability to listen and respond appropriately to various verbal and non-verbal cues. 


But sometimes I think it's just learning the kind of poetry of the skalds and the alliterations and the "heiti"s and "kjenning"s
Let's say it's just a language of its own. But where's my full vocabulary of face-body language!?

Just talk with ppl! Ya?

It also sometimes looks like "we have explained some of the accepted rules of conduct in a given environment. And with this course, we are going to grow people who will support that culture."
I fully endorse some of the items. Like don't be a dick. Act the way you want others to act around you. 

But some of the things that are more like manipulation or hypnosis techniques (see the book "Have You Tried Hypnosis?") for manipulation purposes are really pissing me off. 

Soft yes, please. Do a favor to reach your goal. Empathy (say hi to all neurodivergents in this chat). Just be comfortable for everyone around and do not show you opinion in the most effective way.

F*ck
